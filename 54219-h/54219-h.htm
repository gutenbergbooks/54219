<h2>PREFATORY NOTE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> studies in this book are chosen from a
number written at irregular intervals, and from
sheer interest in their subjects, long ago. Portions
of them, or rough drafts of what has since
been wholly remodelled from fresher and fuller
material at first hand, have appeared within five
years in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Macmillan’s</i>,
<i>The Catholic World</i>, and <i>Poet-Lore;</i> and thanks
are due the magazines for permission to reprint
them. Yet more cordial thanks, for kind assistance
on biographical points, belong to the
Earl of Powis; the Rev. R. H. Davies, Vicar
of old St. Luke’s, Chelsea; the Rev. T. Vere
Bayne, of Christchurch, and H. E. D. Blakiston,
Esq., of Trinity College, Oxford; T. W.
Lyster, Esq., of the National Library of Ireland;
Aubrey de Vere Beauclerk, Esq.; Miss
Langton, of Langton-by-Spilsby; the Vicars of
Dauntsey, Enfield Highway, and Montgomery,
and especially those of High Ercall and Speke;
and the many others in England through whose
courtesy and patience the tracer of these unimportant
sketches has been able to make them
approximately life-like.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">MR. MATTHEW ARNOLD
somewhere devotes a grateful
sentence to the women
who have left a fragrance in
literary history, and whose
loss of long ago can yet inspire men of
to-day with indescribable regret. Lady
Danvers is surely one of these. As John
Donne’s dear friend, and George Herbert’s
mother, she has a double poetic
claim, like her unforgotten contemporary,
Mary Sidney, for whom was made
an everlasting epitaph. If Dr. Donne’s
fraternal fame have not quite the old lustre
of the incomparable Sir Philip’s, it
is, at least, a greater honor to own Herbert
for son than to have perpetuated
the race of Pembroke. Nor is it an inharmonious
thing to remember, in thus
calling up, in order to rival it, the sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
memory of “Sidney’s sister,” that Herbert
and Pembroke have long been, and
are yet, married names.</p>

<p>Magdalen, the youngest child of Sir
Richard Newport, and of Margaret
Bromley, his wife, herself daughter of
that Bromley who was Privy-Councillor,
Lord Chief-Justice, and executor to Henry
VIII., was born in High Ercall, Salop;
the loss or destruction of parish registers
leaves us but 1561-62 as the probable
date. Of princely stock, with three sisters
and an only brother, and heir to virtue
and affluence, she could look with the
right pride of unfallen blood upon “the
many fair coats the Newports bear” over
their graves at Wroxeter. It was the day
of learned and thoughtful girls; and this
girl seems to have been at home with
book and pen, with lute and viol. She
married, in the flower of her youth, Richard
Herbert, Esquire, of Blache Hall,
Montgomery, black-haired and black-bearded,
as were all his line; a man of
some intellectual training, and of noted
courage, descended from a distinguished
brother of the yet more distinguished Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Richard Herbert of Edward IV.’s time,
and from the most ancient rank of Wales
and England. At Eyton in Salop, in
1581, was born their eldest child, Edward,
afterwards Lord Herbert of Cherbury,
a writer who is still the puzzle and
delight of Continental critics. He is said
to have been a beautiful boy, and not
very robust; his first speculation with
his infant tongue was the piercing query:
“How came I into this world?” But his
next brother, Richard, was of another
stamp; and went his frank, flashing, fighting
way through Europe, “with scars of
four-and-twenty wounds upon him, to his
grave” at Bergen-op-Zoom, with William,
the third son, following in his soldierly
footsteps. Charles grew up reserved and
studious, and died, like his paternal uncle,
a dutiful Fellow of New College, Oxford.
The fifth of these Herberts, “a soul composed
of harmonies,” as Cotton said of
him, and destined to make the name beloved
among all readers of English, was
George, the poet, the saintly “parson of
Fuggleston and Bemerton.” Henry, his
junior, with whom George had a sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
peculiarly warm and long, became in his
manhood Master of the Revels, and held
the office for over fifty years. “You and I
are alone left to brother it,” Lord Herbert
of Cherbury once wrote him, in a mood
more tender than his wont, when all else
of that radiant family had gone into dust.
The youngest of Magdalen Newport’s sons
was Thomas, “a posthumous,” traveller,
sailor, and master of a ship in the war
against Algiers. Elizabeth, Margaret, and
Frances were the daughters, of whom
Izaak Walton says, with satisfaction, that
they lived to be examples of virtue, and
to do good to their generation. None of
them made an illustrious match. Margaret
married a Vaughan. Frances secured
unto herself the patronymic Brown,
and was happily seconded by Elizabeth,
George Herbert’s “dear sick sister,” who
became Mistress Jones. In the south
chancel transept of Montgomery Church,
where Richard Herbert the elder had
been buried three years before, there was
erected in 1600, at his wife’s cost, a large
canopied alabaster altar-tomb, with two
portrait-figures recumbent. All around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
it, in the quaint and affectionate boast of
the age, are the small images of these
seven sons and three daughters; “Job’s
number and Job’s distribution,” as she
once remarked, and as her biographers
failed not to repeat after her. But their
kindred ashes are widely sundered, and
“as content with six foot as with the
moles of Adrianus.” This at Montgomery
is the only known representation of
the Lady Magdalen. Her effigy lies at
her husband’s left, the palms folded, the
eyes open, the full hair rolled back from
a low brow, beneath a charming and simple
head-dress. Nothing can be nobler
than the whole look of the face, like her
in her prime, and reminding one of her
son’s loving epithet, “my Juno.” The
short-sighted inscription upon the slab
yet includes her name.</p>

<p>Never had an army of brilliant and requiring
children a more excellent mother.
“<i>Severa parens</i>,” her gentle George called
her in his scholarly verses; and such she
was, with the mingled sagacity and joyousness
which made up her character.
If we are to believe their own testimony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the leading members of her young family
were of excessively peppery Cymric temperaments,
and worthy to call out that
“manlier part” of her which Dr. Donne,
who had every opportunity of observing
it in play, was so quick to praise. There
is a passage in a letter of Sir Thomas
Lacy, addressed to Edward Herbert,
touching upon “the knowledge I had
how ill you can digest the least indignity.”
“Holy George Herbert” himself, in 1618,
commended to his dear brother Henry
the gospel of self-honoring: “It is the
part of a poor spirit to undervalue himself
and blush.” And physical courage
went hand in hand with this blameless
haughtiness of the Herberts, a pretty collateral
proof of which may be adduced
from a message of Sir Henry Jones to his
brother-in-law, the other Henry just
mentioned, concerning a gift for his little
nephew. “If my cozen, William Herbert
your sonne . . .  be ready for the rideing of
a horse, I will provide him with a Welch
nagg that shall be as mettlesome as himself.”
There is no doubt that all this
racial fire was fostered by one woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
“Thou my root, and my most firm rock,
O my mother!” George cried, long after
in the <i>Parentalia</i>, aware that he owed to
her his high ideals, and the strength of
character which is born of self-discipline.</p>

<p>“God gave her,” says one of her two
devoted annalists, who we wish were
not so brief and meagre of detail—“God
gave her such a comeliness as though she
was not proud of it, yet she was so content
with it as not to go about to mend
it by any art.” Her fortune was large,
her benevolence wide-spreading. All the
countryside knew her for the living representative
of the ever-hospitable houses
of Newport and Bromley. “She gave not
on some great days,” continues Dr. Donne,
“or at solemn goings abroad; but as
God’s true almoners, the sun and moon,
that pass on in a continual doing of good;
as she received her daily bread from God,
so daily she distributed it, and imparted
it to others.” In these years of her wifehood
and widowhood at Montgomery
Castle (the “romancy place” dating from
the eleventh century, and ruined, like the
fine old house at High Ercall, during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Civil Wars), and afterwards at Oxford and
London, she reared her happy crew of
boys and girls in an air of generosity
and honor; training them to habits of
hardiness and simplicity, and to the equal
relish of work and play. “Herself with
her whole family (as a church in that
elect lady’s house, to whom John wrote
his second Epistle) did every Sabbath
shut up the day at night with a general,
with a cheerful singing of psalms.”
One may guess at young Richard’s turmoil
in-doors, and at the little Elizabeth’s
soft, patient ways, and think of George
(on Sundays at any rate) as the child of
content, “the contesseration of elegances”
worthy Archdeacon Oley called
him.</p>

<p>The fair and stately matron moving
over them and among them was not
without her prejudices. “I was once,”
Edward testifies, “in danger of drowning,
learning to swim. My mother, upon
her blessing, charged me never to learn
swimming; telling me, further, that she
had learned of more drowned than saved
by it.” Though the given reason failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to impress him, he adds, the commandment
did; so that the accomplished
Crichton of Cherbury, who understood
alchemy, broke his way through metaphysics,
and rode the Great Horse; the
ambassador, author, and beau, to whom
Ben Jonson sent his greeting:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“What man art thou that art so many men,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All-virtuous Herbert?”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">even he lacked, on principle, the science
of keeping himself alive in an alien element,
because it had been pronounced
less risky to die outright! It was a pretty
paradox, and one which sets down our
high-minded Magdalen as quite feminine,
quite human.</p>

<p>Her Edward was matriculated in 1595
at University College, Oxford,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> for which
he seemed to retain no great partiality;
he bequeathed his books, like a loyal
Welshman, to Jesus College, instead, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>his manuscripts to the Bodleian Library.
In 1598, when he was little more than
seventeen, he was wedded to his cousin
Mary Herbert, of St. Gillian in Monmouthshire.
Her age was one-and-twenty;
she was an heiress, enjoined by her
father’s will to marry a Herbert or forfeit
her estates; she was also almost a
philosopher. There was no wild affection
on either side, but the marriage
promised rather well, both persons having
resources; and no real catastrophe
befell either in after-life. Much as she
desired the match for worldly motives,
the chief promoter of it was too solicitous
for her tall dreamer of a son, who
underwent the pleasing peril of having
Queen Bess clap him on the cheek, not
to take the whole weight of conjugal
direction on her own shoulders. Without
undue officiousness, but with the masterly
foresight of a shrewd saint, she
moved to Oxford from Montgomery with
her younger children and their tutors, in
order to handle Mistress Herbert’s husband
during his minority. “She continued
there with him,” says Walton, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
his <i>Life of George Herbert</i>, “and still
kept him in a moderate awe of herself,
and so much under her own eye as to
see and converse with him daily; but she
managed this power over him without
any such rigid sourness as might make
her company a torment to her child, but
with such a sweetness and compliance
with the recreations and pleasures of
youth as did incline him willingly to
spend much of his time in the company
of his dear and careful mother.”</p>

<p>It was during this stay that she contracted
the chivalrous friendship which
has embalmed her tranquil memory. Dr.
John Donne (not ordained until 1614, and
indeed not Dr. Donne then at all, but
“Jack Donne,” his profaner self) had been
at Cadiz with Essex, and had wandered
over the face of Europe; and he came
back, accidentally, to Oxford during the
most troubled year of his early prime. It
was no strange place to him,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
been, at eleven, the Pico della Mirandola
of Hart Hall, and whose relatives seem
to have resided always in the town.
There and then, however, he cast his
bright eye upon Excellence, and in his

<p>We can do no better than cite a celebrated
and beautiful passage, once more
from Walton: “This amity, begun at this
time and place, was not an amity that
polluted their souls, but an amity made
up of a chain of suitable inclinations and
virtues; an amity like that of St. Chrysostom
to his dear and virtuous Olympias,
whom, in his letters, he calls his saint; or
an amity, indeed, more like that of St.
Hierom to his Paula, whose affection to
her was such that he turned poet in his
old age, and then made her epitaph, wishing
all his body were turned into tongues
that he might declare her just praises to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
posterity.” How these words remind
one of the sweet historic mention which
Condivi gives to the relations between
Vittoria Colonna and Michelangelo! The
little English idyl of friendship and the
great Italian one run parallel in much.</p>

<p>Donne’s trenchant <i>Satires</i>, some of the
earliest and very best in the language,
were already written, and he was not without
the hint of fame. Born in 1573, he
was but eight years the senior of Edward
Herbert, and not more than a dozen years
the junior of Edward Herbert’s mother.
To her two sons, also, who were to figure
as men of letters, he was sincerely attached
from the first, and had a marked
and lasting influence on their minds.
Donne had the superabundance of mental
power which Mr. Minto has pointed
out as the paradoxical cause of his failure
to become a great poet. He was a three-storied
soul, as the French say: a spirit
of many sides and moods, a life-long dreamer
of good and bad dreams. To his restless,
incisive intelligence his contemporaries,
with Jonson and Carew at their
head, bowed in hyperboles of acclaim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
He had a changeful conscience, often
antagonized and often appeased. There
was a strain in him of strong joy, for he
was descended through his mother from
pleasant John Heywood the dramatist,
and from the father of that great and
merry-hearted gentleman, Sir Thomas
More. If ever man needed vitality to
buoy him over sorrows heavy and vast,
it was Donne in his “yeasting youth.”
Thrown, through no fault but his own,
from his old footholds of religion and
occupation, and unable, despite his versatile
and alert genius, to grind a steady
living from the hard mills of the world,
he was in the midst of a bitter plight
when the friends worthy of him found a
heavenly opportunity which they did not
let go by, and made his acceptance of
their favor a rich gift unto themselves.
Foremost among these, besides Lady
Herbert, were Sir Robert Drury of Drury
Lane, and a kinsman, Sir Francis Woolly,
of Pirford, Surrey, fated to die in his youth,
both of whom gave the Donnes, for some
nine consecutive years, the use of their
princely houses. John Donne had been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the service of the Chancellor, Lord Ellesmere,
and lost place and purse by the opposition
to his marriage with his “<i>lectissima
dilectissimaque</i>,” Anne More, who was
Lady Ellesmere’s niece, the daughter of Sir
George More of Loxly, Lieutenant of the
Tower, and probably a distant cousin of
his own. No reverses, however, could beat
the pathetic cheer out of him. “Anne
Donne,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> undone,” was one of his inveterate
teary jests over the state of things
at home. He wrote once, with sickness,
poverty, and despair at his elbow: “If
God should ease us with burials, I know
not how to perform even that. But I
flatter myself that I am dying, too, for I
cannot waste faster than by such griefs.”
Five of his twelve children passed before
their father to the grave, the good domestic
daughter Constance upholding
him always, and keeping the house together.
But just as hope dawned with
his appointment to the Lectureship of
Lincoln’s Inn, heavenward suddenly, with
her youngest-born, in 1617, went his dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>and faithful wife, whom he laid to rest in
St. Clement Danes.</p>

<p>About the time when the remorseful old
queen died disdainfully on her chamber-floor
at Richmond, the necessities of this
family called for daily succors, and with
a simple and noble delicacy they were
supplied. Nor did they cease. Magdalen
Herbert was a “bountiful benefactor,”
Donne “as grateful an acknowledger.”
His first letter to her from Mitcham in
Surrey, dated July 10, 1607, is made up of
terse, tender thanks, in his heart’s own
odd language. He sends her an enclosure
of sonnets and hymns, “lost to us,” says
Walton, movingly, “but doubtless they
were such as they two now sing in
heaven.” Dr. Grosart, with a great show
of justice, claims that the sequence called
<i>La Corona</i>, and familiar to latter-day readers,
are the identical sonnets passed from
one to the other. During this same month
of July we know that, paying a call in his
“London, plaguey London,” and finding
his friend abroad,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Dr. Donne consoled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>himself by leaving a courtliest message:
“Your memory is a state-cloth and presence
which I reverence, though you be
away;” and went back after to his “sallads
and onions” at Mitcham, or to his
solitary lodgings near Whitehall.</p>

<p>The attachment, close and deferent
on both sides, was continued without a
breach, and with the intention, at least,
of “almost daily letters.” Thoreau, quoting
Chaucer, so saluted Mrs. Emerson:
“You have helped to keep my life on
loft.” No meaner service than this was
his dear lady’s to John Donne, often heretofore
astray in the slough of doubt and
dissipation; she fed more than his little
children, clothed more than his body, and
fostered anew in him that faith in humanity
which is the well-spring of good
works. He was not a poet of Leigh
Hunt’s innocent temperament, who could
accept benefits gladly and gracefully from
any appreciator; his soul dwelt too remote
and proud in her accustomed citadels.
But this loving help, thrust upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
him, he took with dignity, and after 1621,
when he was able, in his own person, to
befriend others, he gave back gallantly
to mankind the blessings he once received
from two or three. It was something
for Magdalen Herbert to have saved
a master-name to English letters, and
kept in his unique place the poet, interesting
beyond many, whose fantastic but
real force swayed generations of thinking
and singing men; it was something,
also, to have won in return the words
which were his gold coin of payment.
Nowhere is Donne’s sentiment more genuine,
his workmanship more happy and
less complex, than in the verses dedicated
to her blameless name. They have a lucidity
unsurpassed among the yet straightforward
lyrics of their day. Drayton’s self,
who died in the same year with Donne,
might have addressed to the lady of Eyton
so much of his noble extravagance;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Queens hereafter shall be glad to live</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Upon the alms of thy superfluous praise.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Yet in these eulogies, as in most of the
graver contemporaneous poems of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
sort, there is little personality to be detected;
the homage has rather a floating
outline, an unapproaching music, exquisite
and awed. Donne gives, sometimes,
the large Elizabethan measure:</p>

<div class="center">“Is there any good which is not she?”</div>

<p>In the so-called <i>Elegy, The Autumnal</i>,
written on leaving Oxford, he starts off
with a well-known cherishable strophe:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As I have seen in one autumnal face.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The entire poem is a monody on the encroachments
of years, and neatly chronological:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If we love things long-sought, age is a thing</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Which we are fifty years in compassing;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">If transitory things, which soon decay,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Age must be loveliest at the latest day.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It strikes the modern ear as maladroit
enough that a woman in her yet sunshiny
forties, and a most comely woman to
boot, should have required prosody’s ingenious
excuses for wrinkles and kindred
damages. Was life so hard as that in
“the spacious days”? Shakespeare, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
agreement with Horace, had already reminded
his handsome “Will” of the pitiless
and too expeditious hour,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">which also seems, to a nice historical
sense, somewhat staggering. The close
of Donne’s little homily is perfect, and full
of the winning melancholy which was
part of his birthright in art, whenever he
allowed himself direct and homely expression:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">“May still</span></div>
<div class="verse">My love descend! and journey down the hill,</div>
<div class="verse">Not panting after growing beauties; so</div>
<div class="verse">I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Such was John Donne’s first known tribute
to his friend. She must have been
early and thoroughly familiar with his
manuscripts, which were passed about
freely, Dr. Grosart thinks, prior to 1613,
and which burned what Massinger would
call “no adulterate incense” to herself.
Her bays are to be gleaned off many a
tree, and she must have cast a frequent
influence on Donne’s work, which is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
traceable now. He seems to have had
a Crashaw-like devotion to the Christian
saint whose inheritance</p>

<div class="center">“Bethina was, and jointure Magdalo,”</div>

<p class="unindent">not unconnected with the fact that some
one else was Magdalen also; never does
he tire of dwelling on the coincidence
and the difference. In one of his quaintly
moralizing songs, he goes seeking a
“true-love” primrose, where but on
Montgomery Hill! for he is hers, by all
chivalrous tokens, as much as he may be.
Again he cites, and almost with humor:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">“that perplexing eye</span></div>
<div class="verse">Which equally claims love and reverence.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">And his platonics make their honorable
challenge at the end of some fine lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“So much do I love her choice, that I</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Would fain love him that shall be loved of her!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">There was prescience in that couplet. As
early, at least, as 1607-8, the widow’s long
privacy ended, probably while she was at
her “howse at Charing Cross,” watching
over the progress of her son George at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Westminster School; and he that was
“loved of her” was the grandson of the
last Lord Latimer of the Nevilles, junior
brother of a nobleman who perished with
Essex in 1602, and brother and heir of
that Sir Henry Danvers who was created
Earl of Danby in 1625 for his services in
Ireland, and who literally left a green
memory as the founder of the pleasant
Physic Gardens at Oxford. The name
of Danvers, the kindly step-father, is one
of the noteworthy omissions of Lord Herbert
of Cherbury’s <i>Autobiography</i>. But
George Herbert was devoted to him, as
his many letters show, and turned to
him, never in vain, during his restless
years at Cambridge; and into his circle
of relatives, with romantic suddenness,
he afterwards married. Sir John Danvers,
of Dauntsey, Wilts, was twenty years
younger than his wife. It is worth while
to quote the very deft and courtly statement
of the case made at the last by Dr.
Donne: “The natural endowments of
her person were such as had their part
in drawing and fixing the affections of
such a person as by his birth and youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and interest in great favors at court, and
legal proximity to great possessions in
the world, might justly have promised
him acceptance in what family soever,
or upon what person soever, he had directed. . . .
He placed them here, neither
diverted thence, nor repented since. For
as the well-tuning of an instrument
makes higher and lower strings of one
sound, so the inequality of their years
was thus reduced to an evenness, that
she had a cheerfulness agreeable to his
youth, and he had a sober staidness conformable
to her more advanced years.
So that I would not consider her at so
much more than forty, nor him at so
much less than thirty, at that time; but
as their persons were made one and their
fortunes made one by marriage, so I
would put their years into one number,
and finding a sixty between them, think
them thirty apiece; for as twins of one
hour they lived.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>In the August of 1607, a masque by
John Marston was given in the now ruined
castle of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, eighteen
miles from Leicester, as an entertainment
devised by Lord Huntingdon
and his young wife, the Lady Elizabeth
Stanley, to welcome her mother, Alice,
Countess-Dowager of Derby,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “the first
night of her honor’s arrival at the house
of Ashby.” Fourteen noble ladies took
part in the masque, and among them was
“Mris Da’vers.” The name may, perhaps,
be recognized as that of the subject of
this sketch, for Sir John Danvers was not
knighted until the following year; and
it has been so recognized by interested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>scholars who have searched Nichols’s
<i>Progresses of James I</i>. And yet we cannot
be too sure that we have her before
us, in the wreaths and picturesque draperies
of the amateur stage; for there
was another Mistress Da’vers at court,
whose purported letter, dated February
3, 1613, signed with her confusing Christian
names of “Mary Magdaline,” gave
great trouble, thirty years ago, to the experts
of the Camden Society. Besides,
a letter of the good gossipy Chamberlain,
dated March 3, 1608-9, mentions as if it
were then a piece of fresh news: “Young
Davers is likewise wedded to the widow
Herbert, Sir Edward’s mother, of more
than twice his age.” This would seem
to preclude the possibility of the fair
masquer being the same person.</p>

<p>The mother of many Herberts, the
“more than forty” bride, was by nature
a home-keeping character. Among the
correspondence relating to Lord Herbert
of Cherbury, privately printed in 1886 by
the Earl of Powis, are a few pages which
give us invaluable glimpses of the London
household. Lady Danvers’s eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
son, who set off upon his travels soon
after her second marriage, and who applied
himself vigorously to the various diversions
of body and mind catalogued in
the <i>Autobiography</i>, found himself often
pinched for money. In such a strait, not
unfamiliar to other fine gentlemen of his
day, he invariably appealed to the services
of the step-father who was his junior,
in England. The latter, writing how
“wee are all some what after the olde
manner, and doe hartely wish you well,”
seems to have busied himself to some
avail, in concert with his brother-in-law,
Sir Francis Newport (the first Lord
Newport), in securing letters of credit to
Milan, Turin, the Netherlands, and elsewhere,
and in explaining at length, in his
long involved sentences, how matters
could be bettered. Whether or not the
absent Knight of the Bath had reason
to suspect Sir John’s disinterested action
when it came to the handling of pounds
and pence, he does not seem, then or
after, to have burdened him with any
great harvest of thanks. But Sir John’s
faithful wife knew how to defend him, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
a script of May 12, 1615, which may be
quoted precisely as it stands in the Herbert
papers.</p>

<p>A sympathizing reader, aware of sequences,
may wonder whence Sir John
drew “all the powers he can make”! The
dignified letter, with its undulating syntax
and thrifty punctuation, harmonizes
with all we know of this delightful woman,
who could so reproach what she
deemed a shortcoming, without a touch
of temper. How affectionate is the reference
to the “little Florence” who died
young, and to the other children, sufficiently
precious to all that household, except
to the wool-gathering chevalier their
father, far away! Their innocent faces
peer again through a sweet postscript of
their grand-uncle: (“Dick is here, Ned
and Bettye at Haughmond,”) written in
the winter, from Eyton, to the truant at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Hague.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This same genial Sir Francis
Newport, “imoderately desyring to
see you,” confides to his nephew, during
what he complains of as “a verye drye
and hott time”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> for Shropshire farmers,
that “mye syster your mother is confident
to take a iourney into these pts this
somer, the rather, I think, because yo’r
brother Vaugh’n is dead &amp; if yo’ have
a willing harte you maye come tyme
enough to acco’pany her heare, &amp; would
not then the companye bee much the
better?” But we fear the little excursion
never came off. Edward Herbert’s next
visit to his home, presumably after a four-years’
absence, was in 1619; and in May
of that year he accepted the office of
Ambassador to France, and spread his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>ready wing again to the Continent. And
the <i>Athenæ Oxoniensis</i> will not let us forget
that the too spirited envoy had to be
temporarily recalled in 1621, because he
had “irreverently treated” De Luynes,
the powerful but good-for-nothing Constable
of France. It is not insignificant
that this was the year in which George
Herbert wrote to his mother in one of his
consoling moods, bidding her be of good
cheer, albeit her health and wealth were
gone, and the conduct of her children
was not very satisfying!</p>

<p>We know that Lady Danvers had the
“honor, love, obedience, troops of friends”
which became her, and that she lost none
of her influence, none of her serene charm.
Her poet was much with her in his advancing
age. In July, 1625, while the
plague was raging in London, Donne reminded
Sir Henry Wotton of the leisure
he enjoyed, golden as Cicero’s, by dating
his letter “from S’r John Davor’s house
at Chelsey, of w’ich house &amp; my Lord
Carlil’s at Hanworth I make up my Tusculum.”
Many a peaceful evening must
they have passed upon the terraces, within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
sound of the solemn songs always dear
to both. Visitors yet more illustrious
came there from the city; for the noble
hostess had once the privilege of reviving
the great Lord Bacon,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who had fainted
in her garden. We learn, with sympathy,
that “sickness, in the declination
of her years, had opened her to an overflowing
of melancholy; not that she ever
lay under that water, but yet had, sometimes,
some high tides of it.” Death
chose Dr. Donne’s ministering angel before
him, after thirty years of mutual
fealty. Her restless son Edward, now at
home, was already eminent, and wearing
his little Irish title of Baron Castleisland;
her thoughtful Charles was long dead;
her brother, also, was no more; her
daughters were matrons, and dwelling in
prosperity. With but one unfulfilled wish,
that of seeing her favorite George married
and in holy orders,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and after a life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
which left a wake of sunshine behind
it in the world, very patiently and hopefully
Magdalen Newport, Lady Danvers,
entered upon eternity, in the early June of
1627. On the eighth day of the month,
in St. Luke’s, the parish church of Chelsea,
she was buried:</p>

<div class="center">“Old age with snow-bright hair, and folded palm,”</div>

<p class="unindent">the final earthly glimpse of her still
traditionally beautiful. On the first of
July her faithful liegeman, now Dean of
St. Paul’s and Vicar of St. Dunstan-in-the-West,
preached her funeral sermon there,
before a crowd of the great ones of London,
the clergy, and the poor. Izaak
Walton’s kind face looked up from a near
pew, whence he saw Dr. Donne’s tears,
and felt his breaking voice, the voice of
one who did not belie his friend, nigh the
end of his own pilgrimage. In present
grief and among graver memories, he had
the true perception not to forget how
joyous she had been. “She died,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
“without any change of countenance or
posture, without any struggling, any disorder,
. . .  and expected that which she hath
received: God’s physic and God’s music,
a Christianly death. . . . She was eyes to
the blind, and feet to the lame, . . .  naturally
cheerful and merry, and loving facetiousness
and sharpness of wit.” His
own fund of mirth and strength was fast
going; and a haunting line of his youth,</p>

<div class="center">“And all my pleasures are like yesterday,”</div>

<p class="unindent">must have reverted to him many and
many a time. Morbid and persistent
thoughts beset him from this hour, probably,
more than ever, until he had the effigy
of himself, painted as he was, laid in
his failing sight;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> morbid and persistent
thoughts of the ruin which befalls the
bright bodies of humanity, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
surging up in his loneliness, and crowding
out the better vision which yet may
“grace us in the disgrace of death.” His
inward eye was drawn strongly to his
friend’s sepulchre, sealed and sombre before
him, and to what had been her, “going
into dust now almost a month of
days, almost a lunar year . . .  which, while
I speak, is mouldering and crumbling into
less and less dust.” But he ended in a
wholesomer strain, subdued and calm:
“This good soul being thus laid down
to sleep in His peace, ‘I charge you, O
daughters of Jerusalem, that ye wake her
not!’”</p>

<p>The rare little duodecimo which contains
Lady Danvers’s funeral sermon was
printed soon after, “together with other
Commemorations of Her, by her Sonne
G. Herbert,” and offered to the public at
the Golden Lion in Paul’s Churchyard.
The commemorations are in Greek and
Latin. Strangely enough, nowhere is the
sweet and sage poet of <i>The Temple</i> so set
upon his prosody, so given to awkward
pagan conceits, so out of tune with the
ideals of classic diction. But he, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
tenderly loved his mother, has given to
us, in the <i>Memoriæ Matris Sacrum</i>, several
precious personal fragments, and one
more precious whole picture of daily habits
in the lines beginning <i>Corneliæ sanctæ:</i>
her morning prayer, her bath, and
the plaiting of her glossy hair; her housewifely
cares, her fit replies, her writing to
her friends, her passion for music, her
gentle helpfulness; the long felicity of a
glad and stainless life,</p>

<div class="center">“Quicquid habet tellus, quicquid et astra, fruens.”</div>

<p>Dr. Donne died in 1631, whatever was
yet of earth in his spirit healed and chastened
by long pain. His last remembrance
to some he loved was his own
seal of Christ on the Anchor, “engraven
very small on heliotropium stones, and
set in gold, for rings.” Many of those to
whom his heart would have turned, the
“autumnal beauty” scarce second among
them, had preceded him out of England.
But in travelling towards his Maker, he
had that other sacred hope to “ebb on
with them,” and gloriously overtake them,
as he traced the epitaph which covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
him in old St. Paul’s: “<i>Hic licet in occiduo
cinere, aspicit eum cujus nomen est
Oriens</i>.” The tie between himself and
her was not unremembered in the next
generation; for we find John Donne the
younger dedicating his father’s posthumous
work to Francis, Lord Newport, and
when making his will, in 1662, bequeathing
also to the same Lord Newport “the
picture of St. Anthony in a round frame.”
And thus, in a revived fragrance, the annals
of true friendship close.</p>

<p>These rapid, ragged strokes of a pen
make the only possible biography of
Lady Danvers. When Walton wrote of
her, he had the entire correspondence
with Dr. Donne before him.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> “There were
sacred endearments betwixt these two excellent
persons,” he assures us, but disappointingly
hurries on into the highway of
his subject. It is curious that it seems
impossible now to trace these breathing
relics, or others from the same source;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>for George Herbert, in the second elegy
of the <i>Parentalia</i>, has much to say, and
very sweetly, of the industry of his mother’s
“white right hand,” and of the “many
and most notable letters, flying over all
the world.” Much detail is utterly lost
which men who agree with Prosper
Mérimée that all Thucydides would not
be worth an authentic memoir of Aspasia,
or even of one of the slaves of
Pericles, might be glad to remember. A
copy of a song, a reminiscence of the
glow and stir of the days through which
she moved, a guess through a mist at the
blond head,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> the half-imperious carriage,
the open hand, as she went her ways, like
Dante’s lovely lady, <i>sentendosi laudare</i>,—these
are all we have of the daughter of
England’s golden age. It would be easy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>were it also just, to throw a dash of color
into her shadowy history. One would
like to verify the scene at Eyton, while
the news of the coming Armada roused
the lion in Drake, and struck terror into
the Devon towns; and to hear the young
wife, with three lisping Herberts at her
knee, beguile them with mellow contralto
snatches of a Robin Hood ballad, or
with the sweet yesterday’s tale of Zutphen,
where their country’s dearest gave
his cup of water to a dying comrade. A
decade later, before their handsome bluff
father, her other healthful boys stood up
to wrestle, and twang their arrows at
forty paces; or a rosy daughter stole to
his side, and asked him of mishaps in Ireland,
or of the giant laughter bubbling
from the “oracle of Apollo” in a London
street. It is to be believed that one who
watched events through the insurrection
of Essex, through Raleigh’s dramatic trial,
reprieve, and execution, through the national
mourning for the Prince of Wales,
through the fever for colonization, the
savage sea-fights, the great intrigues in
behalf of the Queen of Scots, the religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
divisions, the muttering parliamentary
thunders, the stress and heat of the
exciting dawn of the seventeenth century,
was not unmindful of all it meant to be
alive, there and then. Magdalen Newport’s
girlhood fell on Lyly’s <i>Euphues</i>,
fresh from the printers; the <i>Arcadia</i>
made the talk of Oxford, in her prime;
the dusky splendor of Marlowe’s <i>Faustus</i>
was abroad before her second marriage.
She was, surely, aware of Shakespeare,
and of the wonder-folio of 1623; of the
newest delighting madrigals and antiphons
set forth by one Robert Jones,
when every soul in England had the gift
of music; of rascal Robert Greene’s lovable
lyrics, of Wyatt’s, Campion’s, and
Drayton’s. She wrote no verses, indeed,
but her familiars wrote them; her every
step jostled a Muse. We may assume
that no growth nor loss in literary circles
escaped that tender “perplexing eye.”
Perhaps it glistened from a bench, in the
pioneer British theatre, on the actors of
<i>Volpone</i>, and followed silently, behind the
royal group, the first mincings of the first
dear Fool in <i>King Lear</i>, one day-after-Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
at Whitehall. Last of all, for
whim’s sake, how any sociologist would
enjoy having the honest opinion of young
Lady Herbert, or that of little Mistress
Donne, concerning the person they could
but thank and praise! <i>Utinam vivisset
Pepys!</i> It is a cheat of history that it
preserves no clearer tint or trace of this
chosen passer-by. Such, in truth, she
was, and the quiet vanishing name clings
to her: the woman of durable gladness,
happily born and taught, like the soul
whereof Sir Henry Wotton, who must have
known her well, made his immortal song.</p>

<p>Of the gracious figure of Sir John Danvers
we may be said to lose sight; for he
seems less gracious, as by a Hindoo trick,
as soon as it is written that his wife
departed unto her reward. Comment
on his character is equal comment upon
hers, and adds new force to the classic
episode of a lady philanthropist espousing
a ne’er-do-weel and a featherbrain.
Aubrey, always happy over a little ultra-contemporary
gossip, calls it “a disagreeable
match,” disappointing to the bridegroom’s
kindred; but adds that “he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
married her for love of her wit.” Now,
wit is an admirable magnet, but it is to
be suspected that there was also, and in
the immediate vicinity, “metal more attractive,”
as Hamlet says. In the Chelsea
parish-books is an entry, the first of its
kind, certifying that Sir John Danvers had
settled his account with “the poore,” a
matter of thirty pounds’ loan (in which
the vicar must have connived), for the
year ending in January of 1628. If the
payment were, by any hap, in advance, it
may have fallen in Lady Danvers’s own
lifetime; and if so, it is quite as likely that
she paid it, with an admonition! Her
“high tides of melancholy,” of whose
true cause she certainly would not have
complained to Dr. Donne, had something
to do with this young spendthrift,
who must have had his wheedling way,
sooner or later, with such of her ample
revenues as were yet extant. Perhaps
Lord Herbert of Cherbury was
both shrewd and charitable, in suppressing
mention of his new relative.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
longer one looks into the matter, the
less curious seems his unexplained silence
concerning this late graft of a family
hitherto always respectable and always
loyal.</p>

<p>There are gleams of subsequent private
history in the tell-tale records at Chelsea.
We are not incurably astonished to learn
that as early as May of 1629 was christened
Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John
Danvers and Elizabeth his wife. This
Lady Elizabeth, arriving providentially
with her Dauntsey wealth, having borne
him four children, died, as did his mother,
in 1636; and left him even as she
found him, none too monogamous. In
1648 Sir John Danvers again appeared
at the venerable altars where his first
saint never had a memorial, loving, honoring,
and cherishing a Mrs. Grace Hewes,
Hawes, or Hewet, of Kemerton in Gloucestershire,
and, as it is to be surmised, leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
her tame fortune by a ribbon. His
debts and difficulties, not of one but of
all time, sprout perennially in the registers.
His indefatigable name, oftener
than any rival’s whatsoever, figures as
borrowing and paying interest on a forty-pound
note, which, like a Hydra-head, was
always forthcoming so soon as it was demolished.
This disgraceful business was
the man’s chief concern: for the older
he grew the deeper and deeper he sank
into entanglements, particularly after the
death of the King. It was never doubted,
in his day, but that this was a judgment
on the former Gentleman Usher who affixed
hand and seal to the warrant of his
sovereign’s execution.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> His own family,
it is said, as well as the royalist Herberts
and Newports, dropped his acquaintance;
and who knows whether Mrs. Grace Hewet
was faithful? At his favorite Chelsea, in
the April of 1655, and in about the seventy-fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
year of his age, Sir John Danvers
ended his career by more conventional
agencies than the rope and the knife,
which might have befallen him in the
Stuart triumph of the morrow. His manor
fell an immediate forfeit to the crown.
In 1661, the dead republican was attainted,
and all of his estate which was
unprotected was declared regal booty.
The year before his own burial at Dauntsey
he laid there, “to the great grief of
all good men,” the body of his elder son
Henry, who had just attained his majority.
The Earl of Danby had died, “full of honors,
wounds, and days,” in 1643, while this
Henry, his nephew, was still a hopeful
child; and on him alone he had taken
pains to settle his possessions. But Henry,
in turn, was persuaded to bequeath the
major part of them to his father’s ever-gaping
pocket, the remainder reverting
to one of his two surviving sisters. The
third Lady Danvers, who lived until 1678,
had also a son Charles,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> who petitioned
the crown for his paternal rights, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
died in old age, with neither income nor
issue.</p>

<p>Clarendon quietly indicts Sir John
Danvers as a “proud, formal, weak man,”
such as Cromwell “employed and contemned
at once.” George Bate gives
him a harder character, saying that he
“proved his brother to be a delinquent in
the Rump Parliament, whereby he might
overthrow his will, and so compass the
estate himself. He sided with the sectarian
party, was one of the King’s judges,
and lived afterwards some years in his
sin, without repentance.” But the same
accuser adds the saving fact that Dr.
Thomas Fuller, like Aubrey, was Sir
John’s friend, and, by his desire, preached
many times at Chelsea, “where, I am
sure, he was instructed to repent of his
misguided and wicked consultations in
having to do with the murther of that
just man.” One half surmises that had
the preliminaries of the great struggle
occurred in her time Magdalen Herbert’s
rather austere and advanced standards
of right would have stood it out, despite
her traditions, for the Commons against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<i>Carolus Agnus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> But that would have
been a very different matter from sharing
the feelings of the crude advocates
of revolution and regicide. What
a misconception of her spotless motives
must she have borne, had others
found her in agreement with her vagabond
lord, who treated politics as he
treated the sacrament of matrimony,
purely as a makeshift and a speculation!</p>

<p>He was no raw-head-and-bloody-bones,
this Roderigo-like Briton who won the
approval of Lord Bacon, and whom George
Wither thanks for “those pleasurable refreshments
often vouchsafed”; and whom
very different men, such as George Herbert
and Walton<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and peaceable Fuller
loved. He was a comely creature of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>some parts, a luckless worldling anxious
to feather his own nest, and driven by
timidity and the desire of gain into
treacheries against himself. His short,
thin, and “fayre bodie,” common, as
George Herbert would have us imply,
to all who bore his name, his elegance,
his hospitality, and his devotedness to
his elderly wife, carried him off handsomely
in the eyes of her jealous circle.
His house in Chelsea, commemorated now
by Danvers Street, adjoined that which
had been Sir Thomas More’s, and was presumably
a part of the same estate. All
around it, and due to its master’s genuine
enthusiasm, lay the first Italian garden
planted in England; and there, rolling
towards the Thames, were the long glowing
flower-beds and green orchard-alleys,
which were also the “<i>horti deliciæ dominæ</i>”
recalled thrice in the music of filial
sorrow. This home of Magdalen Danvers
was pulled down, and built over, in
1716. Within its unfallen walls, where
she spent her serene married life, and
where she died, she had time to think,
nevertheless, that she stood, towards evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in the ways of folly, and that hers
was one of those little incipient domestic
tragedies which must always look amusing,
even to a friend.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">IN his own person, Henry
Vaughan left no trace in
society. His life seemed
to slip by like the running
water on which he was forever
gazing and moralizing, and his memory
met early with the fate which he
hardly foresaw. Descended from the royal
chiefs of southern Wales whom Tacitus
mentions, and whose abode, in the day of
Roman domination, was in the district
called Siluria,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> he called himself the Silurist
upon his title-pages; and he keeps
the distinctive name in the humblest of
epitaphs, close by his home in the glorious
valley of the Usk and the little Honddu,
under the shadow of Tretower, the
ruined castle of his race, and of Pen-y-Fan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and his kindred peaks. What we
know of him is a sort of pastoral: how
he was born, the son of a poor gentleman,
in 1621, at Newton St. Bridget, in the old
house yet asleep on the road between
Brecon and Crickhowel; how he went
up to Oxford, Laud’s Oxford, with Thomas,
his twin, as a boy of sixteen, to be entered
at Jesus College;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> how he took his
degree (just where and when no one can
discover), and came back, after a London
revel, to be the village physician, though
he was meant for the law, in what had become
his brother’s parish of Llansantffraed;
to write books full of sequestered
beauty, to watch the most tragic of
wars, to look into the faces of love and
loss, and to spend his thoughtful age on
the bowery banks of the river he had always
known, his <i>Isca parens florum</i>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
which he consecrated many a sweet English
line. And the ripple of the not
unthankful Usk was “distinctly audible
over its pebbles,” as was the Tweed to the
failing sense of Sir Walter, in the room
where Henry Vaughan drew his last
breath, on St. George’s day, April 23, 1695.
He died exactly seventy-nine years after
Shakespeare, exactly one hundred and
fifty-five years before Wordsworth.</p>

<p>Circumstances had their way with him,
as with most poets. He knew the touch
of disappointment and renunciation, not
only in life, but in his civic hopes and in
his art. He broke his career in twain,
and began over, before he had passed
thirty; and he showed great æsthetic
discretion, as well as disinterestedness, in
replacing his graceful early verses by the
deep dedications of his prime. Religious
faith and meditation seem so much part
of his innermost nature, it is a little difficult
to remember that Vaughan considered
himself a brand snatched from the
burning, a lawless Cavalier brought by
the best of chances to the quiet life, and
the feet of the moral Muse. He suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
most of the time between 1643 and 1651
from a sorely protracted and nearly fatal
illness; and during its progress his wife
and his dearest friends were taken from
him. Nor was the execution of the
King a light event to so sensitive a poet
and so passionate a partisan. Meanwhile
Vaughan read George Herbert, and his
theory of proportional values began to
change. It was a season of transition
and silent crises, when men bared their
breasts to great issues, and when it was
easy for a childlike soul,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Weary of her vain search below, above,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In the first Fair to find the immortal Love.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Vaughan, in his new fervor, did his best
to suppress the numbers written in his
youth, thus clearing the field for what
he afterwards called his “hagiography”;
and a critic may wonder what he found
in his first tiny volume of 1646, or in <i>Olor
Iscanus</i>, to regret or cancel. Every unbaptized
song is “bright only in its own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>innocence, and kindles nothing but a
generous thought”; and one of them, at
least, has a manly postlude of love and
resolve worthy of the free lyres of Lovelace
and Montrose. Vaughan, unlike
other ardent spirits of his class, had nothing
very gross to be sorry for; if he was,
indeed, one of his own</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 5em;">“feverish souls,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Sick with a scarf or glove,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">he had none but noble ravings. Happily,
his very last verses, <i>Thalia Rediviva</i>,
breaking as it were by accident a silence
of twenty-three years, indorse with cheerful
gallantry the accents of his youth.
The turn in his life which brought him
lasting peace, in a world rocking between
the cant of the Parliament and resurgent
audacity and riot, achieved for us a body
of work which, small as it is, has rare interest,
and an out-of-door beauty, as of
the natural dusk, “breathless with adoration,”
which is almost without parallel.
Eternity has been known to spoil a poet
for time, but not in this instance. Never
did religion and art interchange a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
fortunate service, outside Italian studios.
Once he had shaken off secular
ambitions, Vaughan’s voice grew at
once freer and more forceful. In him a
marked intellectual gain sprang from an
apparently slight spiritual readjustment,
even as it did, three centuries later, in
one greater than he, John Henry Newman.</p>

<p>Vaughan’s work is thickly sown with
personalities, but they are so delicate and
involved that there is little profit in detaching
them. What record he made at
the University is not apparent; nor is it
at all sure that so independent and speculative
a mind applied itself gracefully
to the curriculum. He was, in the only
liberal sense, a learned man, full of life-long
curiosity for the fruit of the Eden
Tree. His lines beginning</p>

<div class="center">“Quite spent with thought I left my cell”</div>

<p class="unindent">show the acutest thirst for hidden knowledge;
he would “most gladly die,” if
death might buy him intellectual growth.
He looks forward to eternity as to the
unsealing and disclosing of mysteries. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
makes the soul sing joyously to the
body:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I that here saw darkly, in a glass,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And source of things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall, with inlighted rays,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Pierce all their ways!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">With an imperious query, he encounters
the host of midnight stars:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">“Who circled in</span><br />
Corruption with this glorious ring?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What Vaughan does know is nothing
to him; when he salutes the Bodleian
from his heart, he is thinking how little
honey he has gathered from that vast
hive, and how little it contains, when
measured with what there is to learn
from living and dying. He had small
respect for the sinister sciences among
which the studies of his beloved brother,
a Neo-Platonist, lay. Though he was no
pedant, he dearly loved to get in a slap
against the ignorant whom we have always
with us. At twenty-five, he printed
a good adaptation of the Tenth of Juvenal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and flourished his wit, in the preface,
at the expense of some possible gentle
reader of the parliamentary persuasion
who would “quarrel with antiquitie.”
“These, indeed, may think that they
have slept out so many centuries in this
Satire, and are now awaked; which had
it been still Latin, perhaps their nap had
been everlasting!”</p>

<p>He was an optimist, proven through
much personal trial; he had sympathy
with the lower animals, and preserved a
humorous deference towards all things
alive, even the leviathan of Holy Writ,
which he affectionately exalts into “the
shipmen’s fear” and “the comely spacious
whale”! Vaughan adored his
friends; he had a unique veneration for
childhood; his adjective for the admirable
and beautiful, whether material
or immaterial, is “dear”; and his mind
dwelt with habitual fondness on what
Sir Thomas Browne (a man after his
own heart) calls “incomprehensibles, and
thoughts of things which thoughts do
but tenderly touch.”</p>

<p>His occupation as a resident physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
must have fostered his fine eye and ear
for the green earth, and furnished him,
day by day, with musings in sylvan solitudes,
and rides abroad over the fresh
hill-paths. The breath of the mountains
is about his books. An early riser, he
uttered a constant invocation to whomever
would listen, that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">“Manna was not good</span><br />
After sun-rising; far-day sullies flowers.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">He was hospitable on a limited income.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
His verses of invitation <i>To his Retired
Friend</i>, which are not without their
thrusts at passing events, have a classic
jollity fit to remind the reader of Randolph’s
ringing ode to Master Anthony
Stafford. Again and again Vaughan reiterates
the Socratic and Horatian song
of content: that he has enough lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>and money, that there are a thousand
things he does not want, that he is
blessed in what he has. All this does
not prevent him from recording the phenomenal
ebb-tides of his purse, and from
whimsically synthesizing on “the threadbare,
goldless genealogie” of bards! No
sour zealot in anything, he enjoyed an
evening now and then at the Globe Tavern
in London, where he consumed his
sack with relish, that he might be “possessor
of more soul,” and “after full cups
have dreams poetical.” But he was no
lover of the town. Country life was his
joy and pride; the only thing which
seemed, in his own most vivid phrase, to
“fill his breast with home.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Here something still like Eden looks!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Honey in woods, juleps in brooks.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A literary acquaintance, one unrecognized
N. W., congratulates Vaughan that
he is able to “give his Muse the swing
in an hereditary shade.” He translated
with great gusto <i>The Old Man of Verona</i>,
out of Claudian, and Guevara’s <i>Happiness
of Country Life;</i> and he notes with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
satisfaction that Abraham was of his
rural mind, in “Mamre’s holy grove.”
Vaughan was an angler, need it be added?
Nay, the autocrat of anglers: he
was a salmon-catcher.</p>

<p>With “the charity which thinketh no
evil,” he loved almost everything, except
the Jesuits, and his ogres the Puritans.
For Vaughan knew where he stood, and
his opinion of Puritanism never varied.
He kept his snarls and satires, for the
most part, hedged within his prose, the
proper ground of the animosities. When
he put on his singing-robes, he tried to
forget, not always with success, his
spites and bigotries. For his life, he
could not help sidelong glances, stings,
strictures between his teeth, thistle-down
hints cast abroad in the neatest of generalities:</p>

<div class="center">“Who saint themselves, they are no saints!”</div>

<p class="unindent">The introduction to his <i>Mount of Olives</i>
(whose pages have a soft billowy music
like Jeremy Taylor’s) is nominally inscribed
to “the peaceful, humble, and
pious reader.” That functionary must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
have found it a trial to preserve his
peaceful and pious abstraction, while the
peaceful and pious author proceeded to
flout the existing government, in a towering
rage, and in very elegant caustic
English. Vaughan was none too godly
to be a thorough hater. He was genially
disposed to the pretensions of every human
creature; he refused to consider his
ancestry and nurture by themselves, as
any guarantee of the justice of his views
or of his superior insight into affairs.
Yet in spite of his enforced Quaker attitude
during the clash of arms, he nursed
in that gentle bosom the heartiest loathing
of democracy, and shared the tastes
of a certain clerk of the Temple “who
never could be brought to write Oliver
with a great O.” It is fortunate that
he did not spoil himself, as Wither did,
upon the wheels of party, for politics
were his most vehement concern. Had
he been richer, as he tells us in a playful
passage, nothing on earth would have
kept him from meddling with national
issues.</p>

<p>The poets, save the greatest, Milton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his friend Andrew Marvell, and Wither,
rallied in a bright group under the royal
standard. Those among them who did
not fight were commonly supposed, as
was Drummond of Hawthornden, to redeem
their reputation by dying of grief
at the overthrow of the King. Yet
Vaughan did not fight, and Vaughan did
not die of grief. It is so sure that he
suffered some privation, and it may be
imprisonment, for his allegiance, that
shrewd guessers, before now, have
equipped him and placed him in the
ranks of the losing cause, where he might
have had choice company. His generous
erratic brother (a writer of some note, an
alchemist, an Orientalist, a Rosicrucian,
who was ejected from his vicarage in
1654, and died either of the plague, or of
inhaling the fumes of a caldron, at Albury,
in 1665, while the court was at Oxford)<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
had been a recruit, and a brave
one. But Henry Vaughan explicitly tells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>us, in his <i>Ad Posteros</i>, and in a prayer in
the second part of <i>Silex Scintillans</i>, that
he had no personal share in the constitutional
struggle, that he shed no blood.
Again he cries, in a third lyric,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 13em;">“O accept</span><br />
Of his vowed heart, whom Thou hast kept<br />
From bloody men!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">This painstaking record of a fact by one
so loyal as he goes far to prove, to an
inductive mind not thoroughly familiar
with his circumstances, that he considered
war the worst of current evils, and was
willing, for this first principle of his philosophy,
to lay himself open to the charge,
not indeed of cowardice (was he not a
Vaughan?), but of lack of appreciation
for the one romantic opportunity of his
life. His withdrawal from the turmoil
which so became his colleagues may seem
to harmonize with his known moral
courage and right sentiment; and fancy
is ready to fasten on him the sad neutrality,
and the passionate “ingemination”
for “peace, peace,” which “took
his sleep from him, and would shortly
break his heart,” such as Clarendon tells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
us of in his beautiful passage touching
the young Lord Falkland. But it is
greatly to be feared that Vaughan, despite
all the abstract reasoning which arrays
itself against so babyish and barbarous a
thing as a battle, would have swung himself
into a saddle as readily as any, had
not “God’s finger touched him.” A
comparison of dates will show that he
was bedridden, while his hot heart was
afield with the shouting gentlemen whom
Mr. Browning heard in a vision:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“King Charles! and who’ll do him right, now?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">King Charles! and who’s ripe for fight, now?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Give a rouse: here’s in Hell’s despite now,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">King Charles!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">This is the secret of Vaughan’s blood-guiltlessness.
Of course he thanked
Heaven, after, that he was kept clean of
carnage; he would have thanked Heaven
for anything that happened to him. It
was providential that we of posterity lost
a soldier in the Silurist, and gained a
poet. As the great confusion cleared, his
spirit cleared too, and the Vaughan we
know,</p>

<div class="center">“Delicious, lusty, amiable, fair,”</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">comes in, like a protesting angel, with
the Commonwealth. Perhaps he lived
long enough to sum up the vanity of
statecraft and the instability of public
choice, driven from tyranny to license,
from absolute monarchy to absolute anarchy;
and to turn once more to his
“loud brook’s incessant fall” as an object
much worthier of a rational man’s
regard. Born while James I. was vain-gloriously
reigning, Henry Vaughan survived
the Civil War, the two Protectorates,
the orgies of the Restoration (which
he did not fail to satirize), and the Revolution
of “Meenie the daughter,” as the
old Scots song slyly calls her. He had
seen the Stuarts in and out, in and out
again, and his seventy-four years, on-lookers
at a tragedy, were not forced to
sit through the dull Georgian farce which
began almost as soon as his grave was
green.</p>

<p>Moreover, he was thoroughly out of
touch with his surroundings. While all
the world was either devil-may-care or
Calvin-colored, he had for his characteristic
a rapt, inexhaustible joy, buoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
him up and sweeping him away. He
might well have said, like Dr. Henry
More, his twin’s rival and challenger in
metaphysics, that he was “most of his
time mad with pleasure.” While</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">“every burgess foots</span><br />
The mortal pavement in eternal boots,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Vaughan lay indolently along a bank,
like a shepherd swain, pondering upon
the brood of “green-heads” who denied
miracles to have been or to be, and wishing
the noisy passengers on the highways
of life could be taught the value of</p>

<div class="center">“A sweet self-privacy in a right soul.”</div>

<p>His mind turned to paradoxes and inverted
meanings, and the analysis of his
own tenacious dreams, in an England of
pikes and bludgeons and hock-carts and
wassail-cakes. “A proud, humoursome
person,” Anthony à Wood called him.
He was something of a fatalist, inasmuch
as he followed his lonely and straight
path, away from crowds, and felt eager
for nothing but what fell into his open
hands. He strove little, being convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that temporal advantage is too often
an eternal handicap. “Who breaks his
glass to take more light,” he reminds us,
“makes way for storms unto his rest.”
This passive quality belongs to happy
men, and Vaughan was a very happy
man, thanks to the faith and will which
made him so, although he had known calamity,
and had failed in much. Throughout
his pages one can trace the affecting
struggle between things desired and
things forborne. It is only a brave philosopher
who can afford to pen a stanza
intimate as this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O Thou who didst deny to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The world’s adored felicity!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Keep still my weak eyes from the shine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of those gay things which are not Thine.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">He had better possessions than glory under
his hand in the health and peace of
his middle age and in his cheerful home.
He was twice married, and must have
lost his first wife, nameless to us, but most
tenderly mourned, in his twenty-ninth or
thirtieth year. She seems to have been
the mother of five of his six children.
Vaughan was rich in friends. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
known Davenant and Cartwright, but it is
quite characteristic of him that the two
great authors to whom he was especially
attached were Jonson and John Fletcher,
both only a memory at the time of his
first going to London. Of Randolph,
Jonson’s strong “son,” who so beggared
English literature by dying young in
1634, Vaughan sweetly says somewhere
that he will hereafter</p>

<div class="center">“Look for Randolph in those holy meads.”</div>

<p class="unindent">Mention of his actual fellow-workers is
very infrequent, nor does he mention the
Shakespeare who had “dwelt on earth
unguessed at,” and who is believed to
have visited the estates of the Vaughans
at Scethrog, and to have picked up the
name of his merry fellow Puck from
goblin traditions of the neighborhood.
Vaughan followed his leisure and his
preference in translating divers works
of meditation, biography, and medicine,
pleasing himself, like Queen Bess, with
naturalizing bits of Boethius, and much
from Plutarch, Ausonius, Severinus, and
Claudian. He did some passages from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Ovid, but he must have felt sharply the
violence done to the lyric essence in
passing it ever so gently from language
to language, for he lingered over Adrian’s
darling <i>Animula vagula blandula</i>, only
to leave it alone, and to write of it as the
saddest poetry that ever he met with.</p>

<p>Not the least of Henry Vaughan’s
blessings was his warm friendship with
“the matchless Orinda.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This delightful
Catherine Fowler married, in 1647,
a stanch royalist, Mr. James Philips of
Cardigan Priory, and as his bride, became
what, in the Welsh solitudes, was
considered “neighbor” to Vaughan, her
home being distant from his just fifty
miles as the crow flies. She had been,
in her infancy, a prodigy of Biblical quotation,
like Evelyn’s little Richard, and
grew up to be such another <i>précieuse</i> as
Madame la Comtesse de Lafayette, <i>née</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>Lavergne; but we know that she was the
cleverest and comeliest of good women,
and Vaughan’s association with her must
have been a perpetual sunshine to him
and his. She prefixed, after the fashion
of the day, some commendatory verses
to his published work. They are not
only pretty, but they furnish a bit of adequate
criticism. The secular Muse of
the Silurist is, according to Orinda,</p>

<div class="center">“Truth clothed in wit, and Love in innocence,”</div>

<p class="unindent">and has, for her birthright, seriousness
and a “charming rigour.” The last two
words might stand for him in the fast-coming
day when nobody will have time
to discuss old poets in anything but technical
terms and epigrams. Orinda, with
her accurate judgment, should have had
a chance to talk to Mr. Thomas Campbell,
who adorned his <i>Specimens</i> with the
one official and truly prepositional phrase
that “Vaughan was one of the harshest
of writers, even of the inferior order of
the school of conceit!”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>While Henry Vaughan was preparing
for publication the first half of <i>Silex
Scintillans</i> as the token of his arrested
and uplifted youth, Rev. Mr. Thomas
Vaughan, backed by a few other sanguine
Oxonians, and disregardful of his
twin’s exaggerated remorse for the fruits
of his profaner years, brought out the
“formerly written and newly named”
<i>Olor Iscanus</i>, over the author’s head, in
1650, and gave to it a motto from the
Georgics. The preface is in Eugenius
Philalethes’ own gallant style, and offers
a haughty commendation to “beauty from
the light retired.” Perhaps Vaughan’s
earliest and most partial editor felt, like
Thoreau on a certain occasion, that it
were well to make an extreme statement,
if only so he might make an emphatic
one. He chose to supplicate the public
of the Protectorate in this wise: “It was
the glorious Maro that referred his legacies
to the fire, and though princes are
seldom executors, yet there came a Cæsar
to his testament, as if the act of a poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
could not be repealed but by a king. I
am not, reader, Augustus Vindex: here is
no royal rescue, but here is a Muse that
deserves it. The author had long ago
condemned these poems to obscurity and
the consumption of that further fate
which attends it. This censure gave
them a gust of death, and they have
partly known that oblivion which our
best labors must come to at last. I present
thee, then, not only with a book, but
with a prey, and, in this kind, the first
recoveries from corruption. Here is a
flame hath been some time extinguished,
thoughts that have been lost and forgot,
but now they break out again like the
Platonic reminiscency. I have not the
author’s approbation to the fact, but I
have law on my side, though never a
sword: I hold it no man’s prerogative
to fire his own house. Thou seest how
saucy I am grown, and if thou dost expect
I should commend what is published,
I must tell thee I cry no Seville oranges;
I will not say ‘Here is fine,’ or ‘cheap’:
that were an injury to the verse itself,
and to the effect it can produce. Read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
on; and thou wilt find thy spirit engaged,
not by the deserts of what we call
tolerable, but by the commands of a pen
that is above it.” All this is uncritical,
but useful and proper on the part of the
clerical brother, who writes very much as
Lord Edward Herbert might be supposed
to write for George under like conditions;
for he knew, according to an ancient adage,
that there is great folly in pointing
out the shortcomings of a work of art to
eyes uneducated to its beauties. It was
just as well to insist disproportionately
upon the principle at stake, that Henry
Vaughan’s least book was unique and
precious. He was not, like the majority
of the happy lyrists of his time, a writer
by accident; he was strictly a man of
letters, and his sign-manual is large and
plain upon everything which bears his
name. He indites like a Roman, with
evenness and without a superfluous syllable.
One cannot italicize him; every
word is a congested force, packed to
bursting with meaning and insistence;
the utterance of a man who has been
thinking all his life upon his own chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
subjects, and who unerringly despatches
a language about its business, as if he
had just created it. Like Andrew Marvell’s
excellent father, “he never broached
what he had never brewed.” It follows
that his work, to which second editions
were wellnigh unknown, shows scarcely
any variation from itself. It carries with
it a testimony that, such as it stands, it is
the very best its author can do. Its faults
are not slips; they are quite as radical
and congenital as its virtues. Vaughan
(to transfer a fine phrase of Mr. W. T.
Arnold) is “enamoured of perfection,” but
he is fully so before he makes up his
mind to write, and from the first every
stroke of his pen is fatal. It transfixes
a noun or a verb, pins it to the page, and
challenges a reformer to move or replace
it. His modest Muse is as sure as Shakespeare,
as nice as Pope; she is incapable
of scruples and apprehensions, once she
has spoken. What Vaughan says of Cartwright
may well be applied to his own
deliberate grace of diction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Thou thy thoughts hast drest in such a strain</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">As doth not only speak, but rule and reign.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">His verses have the tone of a Vandyck
portrait, with all its firm pensive elegance
and lack of shadow.</p>

<p>Vaughan has very little quaintness, as
we now understand that word, and none
of the cloudiness and incorrigible grotesqueness
which dominated his Alexandrian
day. He has great temperance;
he keeps his eye upon the end, and
scarcely falls at all into “the fond adulteries
of art,” inversions, unscholarly compound
words, or hard-driven metaphors.
If he be difficult to follow, it is only because
he lives, as it were, in highly oxygenated
air; he is remote and peculiar,
but not eccentric. His conceits are not
monstrous; the worst of them proclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“Some love a rose</span></div>
<div class="verse">In hand, some in the skin;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But, cross to those,</span></div>
<div class="verse">I would have mine within”;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">which will bear a comparison with Carew’s
hatched cherubim, or with that
very provincialism of Herbert’s which
describes a rainbow as the lace of Peace’s
coat! Those of Vaughan’s figures not
drawn from the open air, where he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
happiest, are, indeed, too bold and too
many, and they come from strange corners:
from finance, medicine, mills, the
nursery, and the mechanism of watches
and clocks. In no one instance, however,
does he start wrong, like the great influencer,
Donne, in <i>The Valediction</i>, and
finish by turning such impediments as
“stiff twin-compasses” into images of
memorable beauty. The <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>, like Campbell, finds Vaughan
“untunable,” and so he is very often.
But poets may not always succeed in
metaphysics and in music too. The lute
which has the clearest and most enticing
twang under the laurel boughs is Herrick’s,
and not Donne’s; Mr. Swinburne’s,
and not Mr. Browning’s. It is to be observed
that when Vaughan lets go of his
regrets, his advice, and his growls over
the bad times, he falls into instant melody,
as if in that, and not in a rough impressiveness,
were his real strength. His
blessing for the river Usk flows sweetly
as the tide it hangs upon:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Garlands, and songs, and roundelays,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And dewy nights, and sunshine days,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The turtle’s voice, joy without fear,</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And, loaden with the rich arrear,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Spend it in spicy whispers here.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Vaughan played habitually with his
pauses, and unconsciously threw the
metrical stress on syllables and words
least able to bear it; but no sensitive ear
can be otherwise than pleased at the
broken sequence of such lines as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“these birds of light make a land glad</span></div>
<div class="verse">Chirping their solemn matins on a tree,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and the hesitant symbolism of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“As if his liquid loose retinue stayed</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Lingering, and were of this steep place afraid.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The word “perspective,” with the accent
upon the first syllable, was a favorite
with him; and Wordsworth approved of
that usage enough to employ it in the
majestic opening of the sonnet on King’s
College Chapel.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In short, if Vaughan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>be “untunable,” it is because he never
learned to distil vowels at the expense or
peril of the message which he believed
himself bound to deliver, even where hearers
were next to none, and which he tried
only to make compact and clear. His
speech has a deep and free harmony of
its own, to those whom abruptness does
not repel; and even critics who turn
from him to the masters of verbal sound
may do him the parting honor of acknowledging
the nature of his limitation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A noble error, and but seldom made,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">When poets are by too much force betrayed!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Vaughan was a born observer, and in
his poetry may be found the pioneer expression
of the nineteenth-century feeling
for landscape. His canvas is not often
large; he had an indifference towards
the exquisite presence of autumn, and an
inland ignorance of the sea. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
could portray depth and distance at a
stroke, as in the buoyant lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“It was high spring, and all the way</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Primrosed, and hung with shade,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">which etches for you the whole winding
lane, roofed and floored with beauty; he
carries a reader over half a continent in
his</p>

<div class="center">“Paths that are hidden from the vulture’s eyes,”</div>

<p class="unindent">and suspends him above man’s planet
altogether with his audacious eagle, to
whom “whole seas are narrow spectacles,”
and who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3em;">“in the clear height and upmost air</span><br />
Doth face the sun, and his dispersèd hair!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Besides this large vision, Vaughan had
uncommon knowledge how to employ
detail, during the prolonged literary interval
when it was wholly out of fashion.
It has been the lot of the little rhymesters
of all periods to deal with the open
air in a general way, and to embellish
their pages with birds and boughs; but
it takes a true modern poet, under the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the Romantic revival, to sum
up perfectly the ravages of wind and
frost:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Where is the pride of summer, the green prime,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The many, many leaves all twinkling?—Three</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">On the mossed elm; three on the naked lime</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Trembling; and one upon the old oak tree”;</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and it takes another to give the only
faithful and ideal report of a warbling
which every schoolboy of the race had
heard before him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“That’s the wise thrush: he sings each song twice over,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Lest you should think he never could recapture</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The first fine careless rapture.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">That Vaughan’s pages should furnish this
patient specification is remarkable in a
man whose mind was set upon things invisible.
His gaze is upon the inaccessible
ether, but he seems to detect everything
between himself and heaven. He sighs
over the inattentive rustic, whom, perhaps,
he catches scowling by the pasture-bars
of the wild Welsh downs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">“O that he would hear</span></div>
<div class="verse">The world read to him!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever is in that pleasant world he
himself hears and sees; and his interrupted
chronicle is always terse, graphic,
straight from life. He has the inevitable
phrase for every phenomenon, a little
low-comedy phrase, sometimes, such
as Shakespeare and Carew had used before
him:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 10em;">“Deep snow</span></div>
<div class="verse">Candies our country’s woody brow.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It seems never to have entered the
primitive mind of Vaughan to love, or
serve, art and nature for themselves. His
cue was to walk abroad circumspectly
and with incessant reverence, because in
all things he found God. He marks, at
every few rods in the thickets, “those
low violets of Thine,” and the “breathing
sacrifice” of earth-odors which the
“parched and thirsty isle” gratefully
sends back after a shower.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> His prayer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>is that he may not forget that physical
beauty is a great symbol, but only a symbol;
a “hid ascent” through “masks and
shadows” to the divine; or, as Mr. Lowell
said in one of his last poems,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 15em;">“a tent</span></div>
<div class="verse">Pitched for an Inmate far more excellent.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A humanist of the school of Assisi,
Vaughan was full of out-of-door meeknesses
and pieties, nowhere sweeter in
their expression than in this all-embracing
valedictory:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O knowing, glorious Spirit! when</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thou shalt restore trees, beasts, and men,</span></div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">He muses in the garden, at evenfall:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">He has an artist’s feeling, also, for the

</div>
</div>

<p>“I saw,” he says, suddenly—</p>

<div class="center">“I saw Eternity the other night”;</div>

<p class="unindent">and he is perpetually seeing things almost
as startling and as bright: the
“edges and the bordering light” of lost
infancy; the processional grandeur of
old books, which he fearlessly calls</p>

<div class="center">“The track of fled souls, and their Milky Way”;</div>

<p class="unindent">and visions of the Judgment, when</p>

source of his similes and illustrations.</p>

<p>If Vaughan’s had not been so profoundly
moral a nature, he would have
lacked his picturesque sense of the general,
the continuous. That shibboleth,
“a primrose by the river’s brim,” is to
him all the generations of all the yellow
primroses smiling there since the Druids’
day, and its mild moonlike ray reflects
the hope and fear and pathos of the mortal
pilgrimage that has seen and saluted
it, age after age. Whatever he meets
upon his walk is drowned and dimmed
in a wide halo of association and sympathy.
His unmistakable accent marks the
opening of a little sermon called <i>The
Timber;</i> a sigh of pity, tender as a child’s,
over the fallen and unlovely logs:</p>

<p class="unindent">He forgot the closes of these artless
lines of a minor poet; or he did not know
them.</p>

<p>Vaughan’s meek reputation began to
renew itself about 1828, when four critics
eminently fitted to appraise his
worth were in their prime; but, curiously
enough, none of these, not even the best
of them, the same Charles Lamb who
said a just and generous word for Wither,
had the satisfaction of rescuing his sunken
name. Lamb’s friend, the good soul
Bernard Barton, seems, however, to have
known and admired his Vaughan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p>Eight little books, if we count the two
parts of <i>Silex Scintillans</i> as one,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> enclose
all of the Silurist’s original work. He
began to publish in 1646, and he practically
ceased in 1655, reappearing but in
1678 with <i>Thalia Rediviva</i>, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>not issued under his own supervision. It
is commonly supposed that his verses
were forgotten up to the date (1847) of the
faulty but timely Aldine edition of the
Rev. H. F. Lyte, thrice reprinted and revised
since then, and until the appearance
of Dr. Grosart’s four inestimable quartos;
but Mr. Carew Hazlitt has been fortunate
enough to discover the advertisement of
an eighteenth-century reprint of Vaughan.
As the results of Dr. Grosart’s patient service
to our elder writers are necessarily
semi-private, it may be said with truth
that the real Vaughan is still debarred
from the general reader, who is, indeed,
the identical person least concerned about
that state of affairs. His name is not irrecoverable
nor unfamiliar to scholars.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>His mind, on the whole, might pass for
the product of yesterday; and he, who
needs no glossary, may handsomely cede
the honors of one to Mr. William Morris.
It is at least certain that had Vaughan
lately lifted up his sylvan voice out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Brecknockshire, he would not so readily
be accused of having modelled himself
unduly upon George Herbert.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> He has
gone into eclipse behind that gracious
name.</p>

<p>Henry Vaughan was a child of thirteen
when Herbert, a stranger to him,
died at Bemerton, and he read him first
in the sick-chamber to which the five
years’ distresses of his early manhood
confined him. The reading could not
have been prior to 1647, for <i>Olor Iscanus</i>,
Vaughan’s second volume, was lying
ready for the press that year, as we
know from the date of its dedication to
Lord Kildare Digby. As no novice poet,
therefore, he fell under the spell of a sweet
and elect soul, who was also a lover of
vanquished royalty, a convert who had
looked upon the vanities of the court and
the city, a Welshman born, and not unconnected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with Vaughan’s own ancient
and patrician house. These were slight
coincidences, but they served to strengthen
a forming tie. The Silurist somewhere
thanks Herbert’s “holy ever-living
lines” for checking his blood; and it was,
perhaps, the only service rendered of
which he was conscious. But his endless
iambics and his vague allegorical titles
are cast thoroughly in the manner of Herbert,
and he takes from the same source
the heaped categorical epithets, the didactic
tone, and the introspectiveness
which are his most obvious failings.
Vaughan’s intellectual debt to Herbert
resolves itself into somewhat less than
nothing; for in following him with zeal
to the Missionary College of the Muses,
he lost rather than gained, and he is altogether
delightful and persuasive only
where he is altogether himself. Nevertheless,
a certain spirit of conformity and
filial piety towards Herbert has betrayed
Vaughan into frequent and flagrant imitations.
It seems as if these must have
been voluntary, and rooted in an intention
to enforce the same truths in all but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the same words; for the moment Vaughan
breaks into invective, or comes upon his
distinctive topics, such as childhood, natural
beauty (for which Herbert had an
imperfect sense), friendship, early death,
spiritual expectation, he is off and away,
free of any predecessor, thrilling and unforgettable.
Comparisons will not be out of
place here, for Vaughan can bear, and even
invoke them. Dryden said in Jonson’s
praise that he was “a learned plagiary,” and
nobody doubts nowadays that Shakespeare
and Milton were the bandit kings of their
time. There was, indeed, in English letters,
up to Queen Anne’s reign, an open
communism of ideas and idioms astonishing
to look upon; there is less confiscation
at present, because, outside the pale
of the sciences, there is less thinking.
If any one thing can be closer to another,
for instance, than even Drummond’s sonnet
on <i>Sleep</i> is to Sidney’s, it is the dress
of Vaughan’s morality to that of George
Herbert’s. Mr. Simcox is the only critic
who has taken the trouble to contrast
them, and he does so in so random a
fashion as to suggest that his scrutiny,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in some cases, has been confined to the
rival titles. It is certain that no other
mind, however bent upon identifications,
can find a likeness between <i>The Quip</i> and
<i>The Queer</i>, or between <i>The Tempest</i> and
<i>Providence</i>. Vaughan’s <i>Mutiny</i>, like <i>The
Collar</i>, ends in a use of the word “child,”
after a scene of strife; and if ever it were
meant to match Herbert’s poem, distinctly
falls behind it, and deals, besides,
with a much weaker rebelliousness. <i>Rules
and Lessons</i> is so unmistakably modelled
upon <i>The Church Porch</i> that it scarcely
calls for comment. Herbert’s admonitions,
however, are continued, but nowhere
repeated; and Vaughan’s succeed
in being poetic, which the others are not.
Beyond these replicas, Vaughan’s structural
genius is in no wise beholden to Herbert’s.
But numerous phrases and turns
of thought descend from the master to
the disciple, undergoing such subtle and
peculiar changes, and given back, as
Coleridge would say, with such “usurious
interest,” that it may well be submitted
whether, in this casual list, every
borrowing, save two, be not a bettering.</p>

<p>To arraign Vaughan is to vindicate
him. In the too liberal assizes of literature,
an idea becomes the property of
him who best expresses it. Herbert’s
odd and fresh metaphors, his homing
bees and pricks of conscience and silent
tears, the adoring star and the comrade
bird, even his famous female scarf, go
over bodily to the spoiler. In many an
instance something involved and difficult
still characterizes Herbert’s diction;
and it is diverting to watch how the interfering
hand sorts and settles it at one
touch, and sends it, in Mr. Matthew Arnold’s
word, to the “centre.” Vaughan’s
mind, despite its mysticism, was full of despatch
and impetuosity. Like Herbert,
he alludes to himself, more than once, as
“fierce”; and the adjective undoubtedly
belongs to him. There is in Vaughan,
at his height, an imaginative rush and
fire which Herbert never knew, a greater
clarity and conciseness, a far greater restraint,
a keener sense both of color and
form, and so much more deference for
what Mr. Ruskin calls “the peerage of
words,” that the younger man could never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
have been content to send forth a line
which might mean its opposite, such as
occurs in the fine stanza about glory in
the beautiful <i>Quip</i>. It is only on middle
ground that the better poet and the better
saint collide. Vaughan never could
have written</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O that I once past changing were</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fast in Thy Paradise, where no flower can wither!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">or the tranquil confession of faith:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Whether I fly with angels, fall with dust,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Thy hands made both, and I am there:</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thy power and love, my love and trust</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Make one place everywhere!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">For his best is not Herbert’s best, nor his
worst Herbert’s worst. It is not Vaughan
who reminds us that “filth” lies under a
fair face. He does the “fiercer” thing:
he goes to the Pit’s mouth in a trance,
and “hears them yell.” Herbert’s noblest
and most winning art still has its
stand upon the altar steps of <i>The Temple;</i>
but Vaughan is always on the roof,
under the stars, like a somnambulist, or
actually above and out of sight, “pinnacled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
dim in the intense inane”; absorbed
in larger and wilder things, and
stretching the spirits of all who try to
follow him. Herbert has had his reward
in the world’s lasting appreciation; and
though Vaughan had a favorable opinion
of his own staying powers, nothing would
have grieved him less than to step aside,
if the choice had lain between him and
his exemplar. Or re-risen, he would cry
loyally to him, as to that other Herbert,
the rector of Llangattock and his old
tutor: “<i>Pars vertat patri, vita posthuma
tibi</i>.”</p>

<p>Vaughan, then, owed something to Herbert,
although it was by no means the
best which Herbert could give; but he
himself is, what Herbert is not, an ancestor.
He leans forward to touch Cowper
and Keble; and Mr. Churton Collins
has taken the pains to trace him in Tennyson.</p>

of the <i>Allegro;</i> and the fragrant winds
which linger by Usk, “loaden with the
rich arrear,” appear to be Milton’s, too.
His austere music first sounded in the
public ear in 1645, one year before Vaughan,
much his junior, began to print. It would
seem very unlikely that a Welsh physician
should be beholden long after to the
manuscripts of the Puritan stripling, close-kept
at Cambridge and Horton; but it
is interesting to find the prototype of
Vaughan’s charming lines about Rachel,</p>

<div class="center">“the sheep-keeping Syrian maid,”</div>

<p class="unindent">in the <i>Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester</i>,
dating from 1631.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Vaughan’s
dramatic Fleet Street,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p class="unindent">might as well be Swift’s, or Crabbe’s; and

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And now, as fresh and cheerful as the light,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thy little heart in early hymns doth sing,”</span></div>

<p class="unindent">is like a quotation from some tender sonnet
of Bowles, or from his admirer, the
young Coleridge who instantly outstepped
him. <i>Olor</i>, <i>Silex</i>, and <i>Thalia</i> establish unexpected
relationships with genius the
most remote from them and from each
other. The animated melody of poor
Rochester’s best songs seems deflected
from</p>

<p class="unindent">addressed to Amoret,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> in the <i>Poems</i> of

<div class="verse">“As some blind dial, when the day is done,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Can tell us at midnight there was a sun,”</span></div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">(a verse of a poem headed by an extract,
in the Vulgate, from the eighth chapter
to the Romans), come home with a smile
to the lover of Clough. Vaughan was
that dangerous person, an original thinker;
and the consequence is that he compromises
a great many authors who may
never have heard of him. It is admitted
now that we owe to his prophetic lyre
one of the boasts of modern literature.
Dr. Grosart has handled so well the obvious
debt of Wordsworth in <i>The Intimations
of Immortality</i>, and has proven
so conclusively that Vaughan figured in
the library at Rydal Mount, that little
need be said here on that theme. In
<i>Corruption</i>, <i>Childhood</i>, <i>Looking Back</i>, and
<i>The Retreat</i>, most markedly in the first,
lie the whole point and pathos of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Trailing clouds of glory do we come</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From Heaven, which is our home.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Few studies are more fascinating than
that of the liquidation, so to speak, of
Vaughan’s brief, tense, impassioned monodies
into “the mighty waters rolling
evermore” of the great <i>Ode</i>. It is Holinshed’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
accidental honor that he is lost
in Shakespeare, and incorporated with
him. So with Vaughan: if shorn of his
dues, he still remains illustrious by virtue
of one signal service to Wordsworth,
whom, in the main, he distinctly foreshadows.
Yet it is no unpardonable heresy
to be jealous that the “first sprightly
runnings” of a classic should not be better
known, and to prefer their touching
simplicity to the grandly adult and theory-burdened
lines which everybody quotes.
In the broad range of English letters we
find two persons whose normal mental
habits seem altogether of a piece with
Vaughan’s: a woman of the eighteenth
century, and a philosopher of the nineteenth.
The lovely <i>Petition for an Absolute
Retreat</i>, by Anne, Countess of Winchelsea
(whose genius was the charming
<i>trouvaille</i> of Mr. Edmund Gosse), might
pass for Vaughan’s, in Vaughan’s best
manner; and so might</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Their near camp my spirit knows</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">By signs gracious as rainbows,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">as indeed the whole of Emerson’s ever-memorable
<i>Forerunners</i>, itself a mate for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<i>The Retreat;</i> or rather, had these been
anonymous lyrics of Vaughan’s own day,
it would have been impossible to persuade
a Caroline critic that he could not name
their common author.</p>

<p>Our poet had a curious fashion of coining
verbs and adjectives out of nouns, and
carried it to such a degree as to challenge
pre-eminence with Keats.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">“O how it bloods</span></div>
<div class="verse">And spirits all my earth!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">is part and parcel of the young cries of
Endymion. When Vaughan has discovered
something to produce a fresh effect,
he is not the man who will hesitate to
use it; and this mannerism occurs frequently:
“our grass straight russets,”
“angel’d from that sphere,” “the mountained
wave,” “He heavened their walks,
and with his eyes made those wild shades
a Paradise.” A little informality of this
sort sometimes justifies itself, as in the
couplet ending the grim and powerful
<i>Charnel-House:</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“But should wild blood swell to a lawless strain,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">One check from thee shall channel it again!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">And Henry Vaughan shares also with
Keats, writing three hundred years later,
a defect which he had inherited, together
with many graces, directly from Ben Jonson:<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
the fashion of crowding the sense
of his text and the pauseless voice of his
reader from the natural breathing-place
at the end of a line into the beginning or
the middle of the next line. More than
any other, except Keats in his first period,
he roughens, without always strengthening,
his rich decasyllabics, by using what
Mr. Gosse has happily classified as the
“overflow.”</p>

<p>Though the Silurist had in him the possibilities
of a great elegiac poet, and his
laments for his dead are many and memorable,
there is not one sustained masterpiece
among them; nothing to equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
or approach, for example, Cowley’s <i>Ode
on the Death of Mr. William Hervey</i>, in
the qualities which abide, and are visited
with the honors of the class-book and
the library shelf. Yet Vaughan’s elegies
are exquisite and endearing; they haunt
one with the conviction that they stop
short of immortality, not because their
author had too little skill, but because,
between his repressed speech and his extreme
emotions, no art could make out
to live. He had a deep heart, such as
deep hearts will always recognize and
reverence:</p>

<div class="center">“And thy two wings were grief and love.”</div>

<p class="unindent">In the face of eternity he seems so to
accord with the event which all but destroys
him, that sorrow inexpressible becomes
suddenly unexpressed, and his
funeral music ends in a high enthusiasm
and serenity open to no misconception.
Distance, and the lapse of time, and his
own utter reconciliation to the play of
events make small difference in his utterance
upon the old topic. The thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
his friend, forty years after, is the same
mystical rapture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“O could I track them! but souls must</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Track one the other;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And now the spirit, not the dust,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Must be thy brother:</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Yet I have one pearl by whose light</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">All things I see,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And in the heart of death and night,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Find Heaven and thee.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Daphnis</i>, the eclogue to the memory
of Thomas Vaughan, is the only one of
these elegies which, possessing a surplus
of beautiful lines, is not even in the least
satisfying. “R. Hall,” “no woolsack soldier,”
who was slain at the siege of Pontefract,
won from Henry Vaughan a passionate
requiem, which opens with a gush
of agony, “I knew it would be thus!” as
affecting as anything in the early ballads;
and the battle of Rowton Heath took
from him “R. W.,” the comrade of his
youth. But it was in one who bore his
sovereign’s name (hitherto unidentified,
although he is said to have been the subject
of a “public sorrow”) that Vaughan
lost the friend upon whom his whole nature
seemed to lean. The soldier-heart in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
himself spoke out firmly in the cry he
consecrated <i>To the Pious Memory of C. W.</i>
Its masculine dignity; the pride and soft
triumph which it gathers about it, advancing;
the plain heroic ending which
sweeps away all images of remoteness
and gloom, in</p>

<div class="center">“Good-morrow to dear Charles! for it is day,”</div>

<p class="unindent">can be compared to nothing but an <i>agitato</i>
of Schubert’s mounting strings, slowing
to their major chord with a courage
and cheer that bring tears to the eyes.
Vaughan’s tender threnodies would make
a small but precious volume. <i>To the
Pious Memory</i>, with <i>Thou that Knowest
for Whom I Mourn</i>, <i>Silence and Stealth
of Days</i>, <i>Joy of my Life while Left me
Here</i>, <i>I Walked the other Day to spend
my Hour</i>, <i>The Morning Watch</i>, and <i>Beyond
the Veil</i>, are alone enough to give
him rank forever as a genius and a good
man.</p>

<p>“C. W.’s” death was one of the things
which turned him forever from temporal
pursuits and pleasures. Of his first wife
we can find none but conjectural traces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
in his books, for he was shy of using the
beloved name. The sense of those departed
is never far from him. The air
of melancholy recollection, not morbid,
which hangs over his maturer lyrics, is
directly referable to the close-following
calamities which estranged him from the
presence of “the blessèd few,” and sent
him, as he nobly hoped,</p>

<div class="center">“Home from their dust to empty his own glass.”</div>

<p class="unindent">His thoughts centred, henceforward, in
their full intensity, on the supernatural
world; nay, if he were irremediably depressed,
not only on the persistence of
resolved matter, by means of which buried
men come forth again in the color of
flowers and the fragrance of the wind,
but even on the physical damp and dark
which confine our mortality. It is the
poet of dawn and of crisp mountain air
who can pack horror on horror into his
nervous quatrains about Death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A nest of nights; a gloomy sphere</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Where shadows thicken, and the cloud</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sits on the sun’s brow all the year,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And nothing moves without a shroud.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">This is masterly; but here, again, there is
reserve, the curbing hand of a man who
holds, with Plato, a wilful indulgence in
the “realism” of sadness to be an actual
crime. Vaughan’s dead dwell, indeed, as
his own mind does, in “the world of
light.” As his corporeal sight is always
upon the zenith or the horizon, so his
fancy is far away, with his radiant ideals,
and with the virtue and beauty he has
walked with in the flesh. He takes his
harp to the topmost hill, and sits watching</p>

<div class="center">“till the white-winged reapers come.”</div>

<p class="unindent">He thinks of his obscured self, the child
he was, and of “the narrow way” (an
ever-recurrent Scriptural phrase in his
poetry) by which he shall “travel back.”
To leave the body is merely to start
anew and recover strength, and, with it,
the inspiring companionship of which he
is inscrutably deprived.</p>

<p>Chambers’ <i>Cyclopædia</i> made an epic
blunder, long ago, when it ascribed to
this gentlest of Anglicans a “gloomy sectarianism.”
He, of all religious poets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
makes the most charming secular reading,
and may well be a favorite with the
heathen for whom Herbert is too decorative,
Crashaw too hectic and intense,
Cowper too fearful, and Faber too fluent;
<i>Lyra Apostolica</i> a treatise, though a glorious
one, on Things which Must be Revived,
and <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i>
an exceeding weariness to the spirit. It
is a saw of Dr. Johnson’s that it is impossible
for theology to clothe itself in attractive
numbers; but then Dr. Johnson
was ignorant of Vaughan. It is not in
human nature to refuse to cherish the
“holy, happy, healthy Heaven” which he
has left us (in a graded alliteration which
smacks of the physician rather than of
the “gloomy sectarian”), his very social
“angels talking to a man,” and his bright
saints, hovering and smiling nigh, who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 2em;">“are indeed our pillar-fires</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Seen as we go;</span></div>
<div class="verse">They are the city’s shining spires</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3em;">We travel to.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Who can resist the earnestness and candor
with which, in a few sessions, he
wrote down the white passion of the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
fifty years of his life? No English poet,
unless it be Spenser, has a piety so simple
and manly, so colored with mild thought,
so free from emotional consciousness.
The elect given over to continual polemics
do not count Henry Vaughan as
one of themselves. His double purpose
is to make life pleasant to others and to
praise God; and he considers that he is
accomplishing it when he pens a compliment
to the valley grass, or, like Coleridge,
caresses in some affectionate strophes
the much-abused little ass. All this
liberal sweetness and charity heighten
Vaughan’s poetic quality, as they deepen
the impression of his practical Christianity.
The nimbus is about his laic songs.
When he talks of moss and rocks, it is as
if they were incorporated into the ritual.
He has the genius of prayer, and may be
recognized by “those graces which walk
in a veil and a silence.” He is full of
distinction, and of a sort of golden idiosyncrasy.
Vaughan’s true “note” is—Vaughan.
To read him is like coming
alone to a village church-yard with trees,
where the west is dying, in hues of lilac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and rose, behind the low ivied Norman
tower. The south windows are open, the
young choir are within, and the organist,
with many a hushed unconventional interlude
of his own, is rehearsing with
them the psalm of “pleasures for evermore.”</p>

was edited by Hunt in conjunction with an American,
and published at Boston in 1868, may help to account
for the mannerliness of the reference.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31">[31]</a> In the <i>Letters and Memorials of Archbishop Trench</i>,
vol. ii., p. 57, there is a letter bearing upon this point
from Mr. Frank Millson, dated 1868, which deserves serious
consideration from Vaughan’s forthcoming editors.
“I think,” he writes the Dean, “that your supposition
that the 1655 edition is the same book as the one of 1650,
with a new title-page and additions, can hardly be correct,
though I know that Lyte, the editor of Pickering’s reprint,
thinks as you do. The preface to the 1655 edition
is dated September 30, 1654, and contains this passage”
(not given in the <i>Memorials</i>) “which seems to me to
refer to the fact of a new edition. A comparison of my
two copies shows that the 1650 edition consists of half a
sheet, title and dedication, and 110 pages. The second
edition has title, preface, dedication, motto, the 110 pages
of the first edition, with 84 pages of new matter, and a
table of first lines. A noticeable thing in the arrangement
is that the sheets do not begin with new printer’s
marks, as they might be expected to do if the second
part were simply new matter added to the first volume,
but begin with A, the last sheet of the former volume having
ended with G. I am sorry to trouble you with these
trifling details; but as Vaughan has long been a favorite
author of mine, they have an interest for me, and if they
help to show that he was not neglected by readers of his
own time, I shall be glad.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32">[32]</a> Anthologies and cyclopædias nowadays, especially
since Dr. John Brown and Principal Shairp drew attention
to the Silurist in their pages, are more than likely to
admit him. It was not so always. Winstanley, sharp as
was his eye, let Vaughan escape him in his <i>Lives of the
Poets</i>, published in 1687. He is not in the <i>Theatrum
Poetarum</i>, nor in Johnson’s <i>Lives</i>. He is in neither of
Southey’s collections. Mr. Palgrave allows him, in <i>The
Golden Treasury</i>, but a song and a half; Ellis’s sheaf of
excellent <i>Specimens</i> of 1811 furnishes eighteen lines of a
wedding blessing on the <i>Best and Most Accomplished
Couple</i> apologizing for “their too much quaintness and
conceit”; and in Willmott’s <i>Sacred Poets</i> Vaughan occupies
four pages, as against Crashaw’s thirty-five, Herbert’s
thirty-seven, and Wither’s one hundred and thirty-two.
But Vaughan fares well in Dr. George Macdonald’s
<i>England’s Antiphon</i>, and in Archbishop Trench’s <i>Household
Book</i>. Ward’s <i>English Poets</i>, in the second volume,
has a conventional selection from him, as has, at greater
length, Fields’ and Whipple’s <i>Family Library of British
Poetry</i>. There is a goodly list entered under Vaughan’s
name in Gilfillan’s <i>Less-Known British Poets</i>, all
chosen from his devotional work. Thirty-seven religious
lyrics again adorn the splendid <i>Treasury of Sacred Song</i>.
Vaughan’s secular numbers yet await their proper bays,
although a limited edition of most of them, containing a
bibliography, was printed in 1893 by J. R. Tutin of Hull.
Mr. Saintsbury, in his <i>Seventeenth Century Lyrics</i>, has
a small and very choice group of Vaughan’s songs, and
Professor Palgrave, having to do with him for the third
time, gives him large and cordial honor in the eleventh
volume of <i>Y Cymmrodor</i>. In Emerson’s Parnassus he
appears but once. He had his most graceful and grateful
American tribute when Mr. Lowell, long ago, named him
in passing as “dear Henry Vaughan,” in <i>A Certain Condescension
in Foreigners</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33">[33]</a> In one of his prefaces, Vaughan hits neatly at the
crowd of Herbertists: “These aim more at verse than at
perfection.” Where there are noble resemblances, it is
well to remember that two sides have the right to be heard.
Mrs. Thoreau used to say: “Mr. Emerson imitates Henry!”
And she was at least as accurate as the critics who
annoyed her old age by the reversed statement.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34">[34]</a> Mr. R. H. Stoddard owns a copy of the first edition
of <i>Nieremberg’s Meditations</i>, translated by Vaughan in
1654, and published the following year, which has upon
the title-page an autographic “J. M.” supposed, by every
evidence, to be Milton’s. If it be so, the busy Latin Secretary,
meditating his grand work, must have been, on
his part, a reader and a lover of the man who was almost
his equal at golden phrases.</p></div>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE is a narrow dark Essex
Street West in the city
of Dublin, running between
Fishamble Street and Essex
Gate, at the rear of the Lower
Blind Quay. The older people still bluntly
call it what it was called before 1830:
Smock Alley. On its north side stands
the sufficiently ugly church of SS. Michael
and John. The arched passage
still in use, parallel with the nave of this
church, was the entrance to a theatre on
the same site; what is now the burial
vault was once the pit, full of ruddy and
uproarious faces. The theatre, erected
about 1660, which had a long, stormy and
eventful history, was rebuilt in 1735, and
having been turned into a warehouse, fell
into decay, to be replaced by a building of
another clay. But while it was still itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
it was great and popular, and the lane
between Trinity College and the old
arched passage was choked every night
with the press of jolly youths, who, as
Archbishop King pathetically complained,
appeared to love the play better than
study! Among those who hung about
Smock Alley like a barnacle in the years
1694 and 1695, was a certain George Farquhar,
son of William,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> a poor Londonderry
clergyman of the Establishment;
a long-faced peculiar lad of mild
mien but high spirits. He had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>from the north, under episcopal patronage,
to wear a queer dress among his social
betters, to sweep and scour and carry
tankards of ale to the Fellows in hall;
and incidentally, to imbibe, on his own
part, the lore of all the ages. The major
event in his history is that, instead of sitting
up nights over <i>Isocrates de Pace</i>,
he slipped off to see Robert Wilkes and
the stock company, and to decide that
acting, or, as he afterwards sarcastically
defined it, “tearing his Lungs for a Livelihood,”
was also the thing for him.
Wherefore, at eighteen, either because
his benefactor, Bishop Wiseman of Dromore,
had died, or else, as is not very
credibly reported, because he was cashiered
from his class, Master Farquhar,
cut loose from his old moorings, applied
to Manager Ashbury of the Dublin Theatre,
and to such avail that he was able
presently to make his own appearance
there as no less a personage than Othello.
He had a weak voice and a shy presence;
but the public encouraged him. One of
his first parts was that of Guyomar, Montezuma’s
younger brother, in Dryden’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
tragedy of <i>The Indian Emperor</i>. In the
fifth act, as soon as he had declaimed to
Vasquez in sounding sing-song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Friendship with him whose hand did Odmar kill?</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Base as he was, he was my brother still!</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But since his blood has washed away his guilt,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nature asks thine for that which thou hast spilt,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">he made, according to stage directions,
a fierce lunge at his too conciliatory foe.
Guyomar had armed himself, inadvertently,
with a genuine sword, and Vasquez
came near enough to being killed
in the flesh. The man eventually recovered;
but it shows of what impressionable
stuff Farquhar was made, that his
mental horror and pain, during that moment
while he believed he had slain a
fellow-creature, should have turned the
course of his life. He left the stage;
nor would he return to it. Some eight
years after, indeed, he visited Dublin
again, and on the old boards played Sir
Harry Wildair for his own benefit; but
this was at a time when he forced himself
to undertake all honorable chances
of money-making, out of his consuming
anxiety for his family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Wilkes and his wife returned to London,
and the lad Farquhar went with
them. He obtained a commission in the
army from the Earl of Orrery; he was in
Holland on duty during a part of the
year 1700, and came back to England
with one of her earliest military red coats
on his back, in the train of his much-approved
sovereign, William III. He had
already written, thanks to Wilkes and
his incessant urging, his first two plays,
and had seen them successful at Drury
Lane;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> he had also overheard with enthusiasm,
at the Mitre Tavern in St.
James’s Market, Mistress Nance Oldfield,
an orphan of sixteen, niece of the
proprietress, reading <i>The Scornful Lady</i>
behind the bar. Captain Vanbrugh was
duly told of Farquhar’s delight and admiration,
and on the strength of them introduced
the girl to Rich, who did few
things so good in his lifetime as when he
put her upon the stage at fifteen shillings
a week. It was not long before this distinguished
actress and generous woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>destined to lend her gayety and beautiful
bearing to the interpretation of Farquhar’s
women, enlivened the town as the
glorious Sylvia of <i>The Recruiting Officer</i>,
who can “gallop all the morning after a
hunting-horn, and all the evening after
a fiddle.”</p>

<p>“We hear of Farquhar at one time,”
says Leigh Hunt, in a pretty summary,
“in Essex, hare-hunting (not in the style
of a proficient); at another, at Richmond,
sick; and at a third, in Shropshire on a
recruiting party, where he was treated
with great hospitality, and found material
for one of the best of his plays.”</p>

<p><i>Love and a Bottle</i> inaugurated the vogue
of the Farquhar comedy; and Wilkes,
whose name in London carried favor and
precedence, was the Roebuck of the cast.
Its successors, <i>The Constant Couple</i> (with
a framework transferred and adapted
from its author’s earlier <i>Adventures of
Covent Garden</i>), and its sequel, <i>Sir Harry
Wildair</i>, again championed by the
“friendly and indefatigable” Wilkes, who
impersonated the engaging rakish heroes,
had long runs, and firmly established<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
their author’s fame. In 1702 Farquhar
produced <i>The Inconstant</i> (which he had
perverted from Fletcher’s <i>Wild Goose
Chase</i>, as if a fit setting were sought for
the wonderfully effective last act of his
own devising); and after <i>The Inconstant</i>,
<i>The Twin Rivals</i>. <i>The Stage Coach</i>, a
one-act farce in which he had a collaborator,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
dates from 1704, and <i>The Recruiting
Officer</i> from 1706; <i>The Beaux’
Stratagem</i> was written in the spring
of 1707. This is a working record of
barely nine years; it represents a secure
and continuous artistic advance; and it
should have brought its patient originator
something better than the privilege
of dying young, “broken-hearted,” as
he confessed to Wilkes, “and without a
shilling.”</p>

<p>Farquhar had but the trifling income
of an officer’s pay on which to support
his wife and his two little daughters. He
seems to have sought no political preferment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
nor did his numerous patrons put
themselves out to advance him, although
these were the very days when men of
letters were crowded into the public service.
Ever and anon he received fifteen
guineas, then a very handsome sum, for a
play. Perhaps, like his rash gallants, he
had “a head to get money, and a heart to
spend it.” He greatly wished success, for
the sake of those never absent from his
thought; and he complained bitterly
when the French acrobats and rope-dancers
took from <i>The Twin Rivals</i> the
attention of pleasure-seeking Londoners,
much as poor Haydon complained afterwards
of the crowds who surged down
Piccadilly, to behold not his “Christ’s
Entry into Jerusalem” at all, but General
Tom Thumb, holding court under the
same roof.</p>

<p>When Farquhar’s health was breaking,
and debts began to involve him at last,
it appears that the Earl of Ormonde,
his general, prompted him to sell his
commission in order to liquidate them,
and agreed to give him a captaincy. Or,
as is yet more probable, in view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
fact that Farquhar was already known by
the title of captain, he was urged to sell
out of the army, on a given pledge that
preferment of another sort awaited him.
His other industrious devices to secure
support for four having missed fire, he
gladly performed his part of the transaction,
only to experience a fatal delay
on the part of my Lord Ormonde, whose
mind had strayed to larger matters. In
fine, the unkept promise hurt the subaltern
to the heart; he sank, literally
from that hour, of grief and disquietude.
Lintott the stationer, and his old friend
Wilkes stood manfully by him, one with
liberal payment in advance, and one with
affectionate furtherance and gifts; but
Farquhar did not rally. It was to Wilkes,
as everybody knows, that he penned this
most touching testament: “Dear Bob, I
have not anything to leave thee to perpetuate
my memory but two helpless
girls. Look upon them sometimes! and
think of him who was, to the last moment
of his life, thine.” The end came
on or about April 29, 1707, George Farquhar
being just thirty years of age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
While he lay dying in Soho, his last and
best comedy was in progress at the new
magnificent Haymarket, and his audiences,
with a barren benevolence not uncharacteristic
of the unthinking human
species, are said to have wept for him.
He was buried in the parish church-yard
of St. Martin-in-the-Fields,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> where Nell
Gwynne’s contrite ashes lay, and where
her legacied bells tolled for his passing.</p>

<p>Farquhar’s name is always coupled
with those of Congreve, Wycherley, and
Vanbrugh, although in spirit and also in
point of time he was removed from the
influences which formed them. Many
critics, notably Hazlitt, Macaulay, and
Thackeray, have allowed him least mention
of the four, but he is, in reality, the
best playwright among them; and it is
greatly to the credit of a discreditable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>period if he be taken as its representative.
He had Vanbrugh’s exuberant
vivacity, Congreve’s grace, Wycherley’s
knack of climax. Wycherley, retiring
into private life when Farquhar was
born, lived to see his exit; Etherege was
then at his zenith; Dryden’s <i>All for
Love</i> was in the printer’s case, and Otway,
almost on the point of his two great
works, was coming home ragged from
Flanders: Otway, whose boyish ventures
on the stage, and whose subsequent soldiering,
Farquhar was so closely to follow.</p>

<p>Pope, and a gentler observer, Steele,
found Farquhar’s dialogue “low,” and so
it must have sounded between the brave
surviving extravagances of the Jacobean
buskin and the modulated utterances of
<i>Cato</i> and <i>The Revenge</i>. A practical talent
like Farquhar’s was bound to provoke
hard little words from the Popes who
shrank from his spontaneous style, and
the Steeles who could not approve of the
gross themes he had inherited. For sheer
good-breeding, some scenes in <i>The Way
of the World</i> can never be surpassed;
they prove that one cannot hold the stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
by talk alone. It is fortunate for Farquhar
that he could not emulate the
exquisitely civilized depravities of Congreve’s
urban Muse. But his dialogue is
not “low” to modern tastes; it has, in
general, a simple, natural zest, infinitely
preferable to the Persian apparatus
of the early eighteenth century. Even
he, however, can rant and deviate into
rhetoric, as soon as his lovers drop upon
one knee. More plainly in Farquhar’s
work than in that of any contemporary,
we mark the glamour of the Caroline
literature fading, and the breath of life
blowing in. An essentially Protestant
nationalism began to settle down upon
England for good and all with William
and Mary, and it brought subtle changes
to bear upon the arts, the trades, the
sports, and the manners of the people.
In Farquhar’s comedies we have the reflex
of a dulling and strengthening age;
the fantasticalities of the last three reigns
are all but gone; the Vandyck dresses
gleam and swish no longer. Speech becomes
more pert and serviceable, in a
vocabulary of lesser range; lives are vulgarizing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
that is, humanizing, and getting
closer to common unromantic concerns;
no such delicately unreal creature as Millamant,
all fire and dew and perfumery,—Millamant
who could not suffer to have
her hair done up in papers written in
prose, and who, quite by herself, is a vindication
of what Mr. Allibone is pleased
to call “Lamb’s sophistical and mischievous
essay,”—walks the world of Farquhar.
With him, notwithstanding that the sorry
business to be despatched is the same old
amorous intrigue, come in at once less
license, less affectation, less Gallicism.
He reports from the beginning what he
himself apprehends; his plays are shorthand
notes, albeit timid in character, upon
the transitional and prosaic time. His
company is made up of individuals he
had seen in a thousand lights at the
Spread Eagle and the Rummer; in the
Inner Temple and in St. James’s Park;
in barracks domestic and foreign; and
in his native place, where adventurers,
eloquent in purest Londonderry,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> stumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
along full of whiskey and ideas.
He anticipates certain phases of Private
Ortheris’s thorough-going love of London,
and figures his exiled Dicky as “just
dead of a consumption, till the sweet
smoke of Cheapside and the dear perfume
of Fleet-ditch” made him a man
again. In this laughing affectionate apprehension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of the local and the temporal
lies Farquhar’s whole strength or weakness.
From the poets of the Restoration
there escapes, most incongruously,
now and then, something which betokens
a sense of natural beauty, or even a recognition
of the divine law; but Farquhar
is not a poet, and this spray from the
deeps is not in him. He perceives nothing
that is not, and opens no crack or
chink where the fancy can air itself for a
moment and</p>

<div class="center">—“step grandly out into the infinite.”</div>

<p class="unindent">Such a lack would not be worth remarking
in the debased and insincere writers
who but just preceded him. But from
the very date of his first dealings with
London managers, idealism was abroad,
and a man with affinities for “the things
that are more excellent” need have feared
no longer to divulge them, since the
court and the people, if not the dominant
town gentry, were with him. Farquhar
had neither the full moral illumination
nor the will, though he had the
capacity, to lend a hand to the blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
work waiting for the opportunist. He was
young, he was of provincial nurture; he
was carried away by the theatrical tradition.
Yet his mind was a Medea’s kettle,
out of which everything issued cleaner
and more wholesome. Despite the
prodigious animal spirits of his characters,
they conduct their mad concerns
with sense and moderation; they manage
tacitly to proclaim themselves as temporarily
“on a tear,” as going forth to
angle in angling weather, and as likely to
lead sober citizen lives from to-morrow
on. Under bad old maintained conditions
they develop traits approximately
worthy of the <i>Christian Hero</i>. They
“look before and after.” They are to
be classed as neutrals and nondescripts,
for they have all the swagger of their
lax progenitors, and none of their deviltry.
They belong professionally to
one family, while they bear a tantalizing
resemblance to another. Farquhar
himself, perhaps unaware that partisanship
is better than compromise,
made his bold toss for bays both spiritual
and temporal. Imitating, as novices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
will ever do, the art back of him, he
adopted the claim to approbation which
that art never dreamed of. In the very
good preface to <i>The Twin Rivals</i> (which
has always been approved of critics rather
than of audiences), he sets up for a
castigator of vice and folly, and he offers
to appease “the ladies and the clergy,”
as, in some measure apparent to the
more metaphysical among them, he
may have done. His friend, Mr. John
Hopkins, the author of <i>Amasia</i>, invited,
on behalf of <i>The Constant Couple</i>, the
commendation of Collier. That open-minded
censor may have seen with
satisfaction, in the general trend of
Farquhar’s composition, the less and less
dubious day-beams of Augustan decency.
Though Farquhar did not live, like Vanbrugh
and the magnanimous Dryden, to
admit the abuse of a gift, and to deplore
it, he alone, of the minor dramatists,
seems all along to have had a negative
sort of conscience better than none. His
instincts continually get the better not
only of his environment, but of his practice.
Some uneasiness, some misgiving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
are at the bottom of his homely materialism.
He thinks it best, on the whole, to
forswear the temptation to be sublime,
and to keep to his cakes and ale; and
for cakes and ale he had an eminent
and inborn talent. What was ably said
of Hogarth, the great exemplar, will cover
all practicians of his school: “He
had an intense feeling for and command
over the impressions of senses and
habit, of character and passion, the serious
and the comic; in a word, of nature
as it fell in with his own observation, or
came into the sphere of his actual experience.
But he had little power beyond
that sphere, or sympathy for that which
existed only in idea. He was ‘conformed
to this world, not transformed.’” Or,
as Leigh Hunt, in his beautiful memoir,
adds, with acuteness, of Farquhar himself:
“He could turn what he had experienced
in common life to the best account,
but he required in all cases the
support of ordinary associations, and could
not project his spirit beyond them.” In
short, Farquhar lacked imagination. He
had insight, however, of another order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
which is his praise, and which distinguishes
him from all his fellows: he had
sympathy and charity.</p>

<p>The major blot on the literature of the
English stage of the period is not its
libertinism, but rather its concomitant
utter heartlessness. “Arrogance” (so, according
to Erasmus, that ascetic scholar
Dean Colet used to remind his clergy)
“is worse than a hundred concubines.”
The slight sporadic touches of tenderness,
of pity, of disinterested generosity,
to be found by patient search in Congreve,
come in boldly with Farquhar,
and boldly overrun his prompter’s books.
Vanbrugh’s scenes stand on nothing but
their biting and extravagant sarcasm.
As Congreve’s characters are indiscriminately
witty, so Vanbrugh’s are universally
and wearisomely cynical, and at the
expense of themselves and all society.
His women in high life have no individuality;
they wear stings of one pattern.
The genial conception of the shrewd,
material Mrs. Amlet, however, in <i>The
Confederacy</i>, is worthy of Farquhar, and
certainly Congreve himself could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
have bettered her in the execution.
Etherege’s typical Man of Mode is a tissue
of untruth, hardness, and scorn, all
in impeccable attire; a most mournful
spectacle. Thinking of such dainty monsters,
Macaulay let fly his famous invective
against their creators: “Foreheads
of bronze, hearts like the nether millstone,
and tongues set on fire of hell!”
George Farquhar may be exempted altogether
from this too-deserved compliment.
There is honest mirth in his
world of fiction, there is dutifulness,
there is true love, there are good women;
there is genuine friendship between
Roebuck and Lovewell, between Trueman
and Hermes Wouldbe, between Aimwell
and Archer, and between the green
Tummas of <i>The Recruiting Officer</i> and
his Costar, whom he cannot leave behind.
Sylvia, Angelica, Constance, Leanthe,
Oriana, Dorinda, free-spoken as they are,
how they shine, and with what morning
freshness, among the tiger-lilies of that
evil garden of the Restoration drama!
These heroines are an innovation, for
they are maids, not wedded wives. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
to the immortal periwigged young bloods
their suitors, they are “real gentlemen,”
as Hazlitt, who loved Farquhar, called
them, “and only pretended impostors;”
or, to quote Farquhar’s latest editor, Mr.
A. C. Ewald, they are “always men and
never yahoos.” Their author had no
interest in “preferring vice, and rendering
virtue dull and despicable.” Their
praise may be negative, but it establishes
a wide wall of difference between them
and the fops and cads with whom they
have been confounded. In their conversations,
glistening with epigram and
irony, malevolence has no part; they
sneer at no virtue, they tamper with
none; and at every turn of a selfish
campaign they find opportunity for honorable
behavior. From the mouths of
these worldlings comes satire, hot and
piping, against worldliness; for Farquhar
is as moralizing, if not as moral, as he
dares be. Some of the least attractive
of them, the most greedy and contriving,
have moments of sweetly whimsical
and optimistic speech. Thus Benjamin
Wouldbe, the plotter against his elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
brother in <i>The Twin Rivals</i>, makes his
adieu after the fashion of a true gallant:
“I scorn your beggarly benevolence!
Had my designs succeeded, I
would not have allowed you the weight
of a wafer, and therefore will accept
none.” The same person soars again
into a fine Aurelian speculation: “Show
me that proud stoic that can bear success
and champagne! Philosophy can
support us in hard fortune, but who can
have patience in prosperity?” Over his
men and women in middle life Farquhar
lingers with complacence entirely foreign
to his colleagues, to whom mothers,
guardians, husbands, and other apple-guarding
dragons were uniformly ridiculous
and odious. Justice Balance is as
attractive as a hearth-fire on a December
night; so is Lady Bountiful. Over
Fairbank, the good goldsmith, Farquhar
gets fairly sentimental, and permits
him to drop unaware into decasyllabics,
like the pastoral author of <i>Lorna
Doone</i>. His rogues are merely roguish,
in the softened sense of the word; in his
panorama, though black villains come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and go, it is only for an instant, and to
further some one dramatic effect. He
has eulogy for his heroes when they deserve
it, and when they do not you may
trust him to find a compassionate excuse;
as when poor Leanthe feelingly says of
her lover that “his follies are weakly
founded upon the principles of honor,
where the very foundation helps to undermine
the structure.” Even Squire Sullen,
for his lumpishness, is divorced without
derision, and in a peal of harmless
laughter. Farquhar, indeed, is all gentleness,
all kindness. He had the pensive
attitude of the true humorist towards the
world he laughed at; his characters let
slip words too deep for their living auditors.
It is curious that to a Restoration
dramatist, “a nether millstone,” we
should owe a perfect brief description of
ideal married life. In the scene of the
fourth act of <i>Sir Harry Wildair</i>, where
Lady Lurewell, with her “petrifying affectation,”
is trying to tease Sir Harry
out of all endurance on the subject of
his wife (whom he believes to be lost or
dead), and the degree of affection he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
for her, he makes reply: “My own heart
whispered me her desires, ’cause she herself
was there; no contention ever rose
but the dear strife of who should most
oblige—no noise about authority, for neither
would stoop to command, where
both thought it glory to obey.” This is
meant to be spoken rapidly, and not
without its tantalizing lack of emphasis;
but what a pearl it is, set there in the
superlatively caustic dialogue! English
chivalry and English literature have no
such other golden passage in their rubrics,
unless it be the famous tribute to
the Lady Elizabeth Hastings that “to
love her was a liberal education,” or
Lovelace’s unforgettable song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I could not love thee, dear, so much,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Loved I not Honour more!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The passage takes on a very great accidental
beauty when we remember that it
required courage, in its time and place,
to have written it. It is characteristic
also of Farquhar that it should be introduced,
as it is, on the top wave of a vivacious
and stormy conversation, which immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sweeps it under, as if in proof
that he understood both his art and his
audience. The conjugal tie, among the
leaders of fashion, was still something
to laugh at and to toy with. Captain
Vanbrugh, from whom nobody need expect
much edification, had put in the
mouth of his Constant, in a play which
was a favorite with Garrick, a bit of
sense and sincerity quoted, as it deserved
to be, by Hunt: “Though marriage be a
lottery in which there are a wondrous
many blanks, yet there is one inestimable
lot in which the only heaven on earth is
written.” And again: “To be capable
of loving one is better than to possess a
thousand.” This was in 1698, and Farquhar
therefore was not first, nor alone,
in daring to speak for the derided idea
of wedlock. Steele was soon to arise as
the very champion of domestic life; and
English wit, since he wrote, has never
subsisted by its mockery of the conditions
which create</p>

<div class="center">“home-keeping days and household reverences.”</div>

<p class="unindent">But it was Farquhar who spoke in behalf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of these the most memorable word
of his generation. After that lofty evidence
of what he must be suspected to
have been, it is well to see, as best we
may, what manner of man George Farquhar
was. And first let us take some
extracts from his own account of himself,
“candid and modest,” as Hunt
named it.</p>

<p>He gives us to understand that he had
an ardent temperament, held in check
by an introspective turn of thought,
by natural bashfulness, and by habits
of consideration for others. The portrait
is drawn from a letter in the <i>Miscellanies</i>,
of “a mind and person generally
dressed in black,” and might have
come bodily, and with charming grace,
from <i>The Spectator</i>. “I have very little
estate but what lies under the circumference
of my hat . . .  and should I
by misfortune come to lose my head, I
should not be worth a groat.” “I am
seldom troubled by what the world calls
airs and caprices, and I think it an idiot’s
excuse for a foolish action to say: ‘’Twas
my humor.’” “I cannot cheerfully fix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to any study which bears not a pleasure
in the application.” “Long expectation
makes the blessing always less to me; I
lose the great transport of surprise.” “I
am a very great epicure; for which reason
I hate all pleasure that’s purchased
by excess of pain. I can’t relish the jest
that vexes another. In short, if ever I
do a wilful injury, it must be a very great
one.” “I have many acquaintances, very
few intimates, but no friend; I mean, in
the old romantic way.” “I have no secret
so weighty but that I can bear it in
my own breast.” “I would have my passion,
if not led, at least waited on by my
reason.” This last text, repeated elsewhere
by Farquhar, which is the counterpart
of one in Sir Philip Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i>,
has interest from the lips of a child
of the “dancing, drinking, and unthinking
time.” Farquhar’s face, in the old
prints, is wonderfully of a piece with
these amiable reports: a handsome, humane,
careworn, melancholy young face,
the negation of the contemporary idea of
the man about town. His constitution,
at its best, was but frail. “You are as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
dear to me,” he says, pathetically, to his
Penelope, “as my hopes of waking in
health to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>A tradition has been received without
question by his many critics and biographers,
that his chief characters, all cast in
the same animated mould, are but incognitos
of himself. Highly-colored projections
of himself, with latent traits exaggerated,
and formed mental restraints
removed, they may indeed be. The public,
which loves identifications, insisted
on finding him revealed in his Archers
and Sir Harrys. Whether or not the
dramatists of the day had universally the
Rembrandtesque whim of painting themselves
into their own foregrounds, they
were obstinately supposed to do so, with
Etherege in Young Bellair, with Otway
in Jaffier. But the real Farquhar</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">—“courteous, facile, sweet,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Hating that solemn vice of greatness, pride,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">with his reserve, his simple dress, his thin,
agreeable voice, his early reputation at
college for uncongeniality, acting in every
emergency whither we can fairly trace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
him with deliberate high-mindedness, is
far enough from the temper of his restless
and jocund creations. He wished
to remove the impression that he could
have been his own model; for he took
pains to inscribe <i>The Inconstant</i> to his
classmate, Richard Tighe, and to compliment
him upon his kinship with Mirabel,
“a gay, splendid, easy, generous,
fine young gentleman”; the applauded
type, in short, of all that Farquhar’s
heroes set out to be. Again, lest he
should pass for a realist as rabid as
Mademoiselle de Scudéry, who pinioned
three hundred and seventy of her acquaintances
between the covers of <i>Clélie</i>,
Farquhar adds this warning to his enthusiastic
dedication of <i>The Recruiting
Officer</i> “to all friends round the Wrekin”:
“Some little turns of humor that I met
with almost within the shade of that famous
hill gave the rise to this comedy;
and people were apprehensive that, by
the example of some others, I would
make the town merry at the expense of
the country gentleman. But they forgot
that I was to write a comedy, not a libel.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
He disclaims everywhere, with the same
playful decisiveness, the interpretations
put upon his designs and actions by the
world of overgrown infants which he entertained.
Endowed with courage and
much personal charm, he had small chance
of distinguishing himself upon the field,
and for the most part shone at a garrison
mess; but he had led a not inadventurous
life, in which were incidents of
the most pronounced melodrama, with a
touch of mystery to enhance their value
for the curious. Farquhar had travelled,
and with an open, not an insular mind;
he had, by his own confession, too deep
an acquaintance with wine, and with the
nightingales of Spring Gardens, outsinging
“the chimes at midnight, Master
Shallow”; he had been, in short, though
with “melancholy as his every-day apparel,”
alive and abroad as a private Whig
of the Revolution, shy of ladies’ notice
till it came, and proud of it ever after.
When he printed, in his twenty-first year,
<i>The Adventures of Covent Garden</i>, he
added to it a boy’s bragging motto: <i>Et
quorum pars magna fui</i>. The inference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
seems to have clung closer to him than
he found comfortable. He complains,
not without significance, in his prose
essay upon the drama, that the public
think any rôle compounded of “practical
rake and speculative gentleman is, ten to
one, the author’s own character.” With
the incident which furnished its thrilling
closing scenes to <i>The Inconstant</i>, Farquhar
had probably no connection; he
takes pains to state that the hero of it
was the Chevalier de Chastillon, quite as
if he feared another confusion of himself,
as fearless and quick-witted a man, with
the “golden swashbucklers” of his imagination.
The rumor which confounded
them with him has next to nothing to
support it. Fortune, fashion, foolhardiness,
impudence, were not the stars which
shone upon Farquhar’s nativity. Such
exotic and epic virtues as may flourish
under these, such as do adorn the delightful
dandies he depicted, surely belonged
to him in person; and his quiet habit of
living apart and letting the town talk,
fixed to perpetuity the belief that he had
exploited himself vicariously, for good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and all, upon the stage. Certain qualities
of his, certain brave truces established
with adverse conditions, force one to consider
him with more attention and respect
than even his brilliant pen invites.
It is something to find him diffident and
studious in a bacchanalian society, and
with such scrupulous sensitiveness that a
mere inadvertence in boyhood forbade
him ever to fence again;<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> but his outstanding
characteristic, the thing which
sets him apart from his brocaded <i>dramatis
personæ</i>, is his known lasting devotion to
the welfare of his family, and his admirable
behavior in relation to his early and
extraordinary marriage.</p>

<p>In 1702, Farquhar issued a charming
and little-known miscellany, called <i>Love
and Business</i>, “a collection of occasionary
verse and epistolary prose.” The poetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>exercises are of small importance; but
the other data (which survive as a hindrance,
rather than as a help, to biographers)
come near being of very definite
value. All manner of futile guesses have
been expended upon the identification of
his Penelope. It is given to no mouser
to name her with certainty; but, despite
the gossip of the greenroom, now as ever
too ready to weave romances about the
name of George Farquhar, internal evidence
is strongly against her having been
Anne Oldfield. Yet this is the supposition
of most of his editors. Commenting
upon one passage touching some villanous
stratagem from which Farquhar says he
was able to rescue a friend in the Low
Countries, a friend with whom he afterwards
condoles upon a robbery she had
undergone, Leigh Hunt adds that this may
have been the woman whom Farquhar
subsequently made his wife. A widow,
whose Christian name was Margaret, but
of whom we know so little else that we
cannot say whether she was English, or
whether her age considerably exceeded
his, conceived a passionate attachment for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
him, and managed to have it represented
to him from several quarters not only
that she was kindly disposed towards him,
but that it would be well for his opening
career if he should seek her hand, as she
had estates and revenues. Eventually,
after we know not what hesitations natural
to a fastidious temperament, he proposed
to her and was accepted, and it
soon transpired that the bride was quite
as penniless as himself. Hunt does not
follow out his own hint in the matter of
the robbery, though the question, when
carefully considered, has a vital import.
If the victim were indeed the lady whom
Farquhar married later, and if she were
indeed robbed, it should signify that she
must then have been possessed of some
wealth, so that the report given to Farquhar
could not have been, up to that
time at least, a lie. On the other hand,
casuists must decide whether, again in
the event of the victim having been correctly
identified by Hunt, the robbery
itself may not have been an invention
meant, after Farquhar had declared his
allegiance, to quicken his sympathy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to soften the coming revelation that the
robbery could never have resulted, owing
to a defect in the premises! There is
very much else about the <i>Letters</i> which
is confusing and inconsistent. They are
so disconnected, and they vary so in
tone and manner, as to suggest a doubt
whether, if not altogether imaginary, they
could have been meant for any one person.
A lady is announced as having returned
them for publication; she dresses
in mourning, and resides now on the
Continent, now in London or in the
country; her suitor very explicitly states
that he had long solicited in vain the
honor of her hand; and, in the end, with
farewells and an abrupt and unexplained
severing, he gives up the quest, with his
own admission that he has lost her and
that her heart “had no room for him.”
Now that the recipient of this correspondence,
Anne Oldfield or another,
should have returned it for commercial
purposes, not having been won by the
very real passion exhibited in parts of it,
seems somewhat peculiar; but to accept
as fact that Farquhar himself actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
asked these letters back from her, and
printed them as they stood, is, under the
conditions, absurd, and irreconcilable with
our knowledge of his character from other
and prior sources. Hunt further suggests
that the <i>Miscellany</i> was gathered together
in some press of pecuniary trouble;
and its title, indeed, may hint at a whimsical
expectation that Love, being harnessed
and sent abroad to arouse curiosity
among readers, may return in the way
of Business to headquarters. But Farquhar,
in his bachelor days, had a fair income,
and would not have been so likely
to hear the wolf at the door as he was
later, when that sound would awake in
him a dread not ominous to himself alone.
It is possible that the undiscovered register
of his marriage bears the date of
1702 or even of 1701; if it were so, that
might explain the issue of his only book
not in dramatic dress, and the emergency
which called it forth. It is difficult indeed
to suppose, although modern delicacy
in these matters was just then a
somewhat unknown quantity, that we
have between its covers genuine love-letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
hot from the pen. Steele, of an August
morning nine years later, inserted in
<i>The Spectator</i> as the communication of a
third person, six of his own notes to his
comely and noble <i>fiancée</i>, Mary Scurlock.
But Farquhar had not Steele’s
earnestness and love of circumstantial
truth, nor his zest for pointing a moral.
Or was this publication the sort of thing
he would be likely, for a not unworthy
purpose, to do? Was he, in reality, a
shade more obtuse and misguided than
Miss Fanny Brawne? Rather let us believe
the <i>Letters</i> a work of fiction, and
only founded largely upon various bygone
moods and incidents of the foregoing
two years, which for one reason
or another might interest buyers. Such
is the description to “dear Sam” of Dryden’s
erratic funeral, which is almost
too keenly rhetorical a summing-up to
have been written the next day, or the
thoughtful and sensible surveys of the
Dutch. The amatory epistles, with their
leaven of reality, are presumably edited
out of all recognition. They make no
defined impression; they do not move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
forward; they veil impenetrably the traits
of the person addressed, who is made to
appear as a vanishing unrelenting goddess,
deaf and blind to George Farquhar pleading
his best. Whatever were the facts,
the report of them is chivalrous. Assume
for a moment that his wife stands
behind the whole of this correspondence,
or even behind the latter part of it, and
what seemed to constitute a little betrayal
in the very worst taste turns out to be
an innocent joke. Of course the “lady”
(or one of the ladies) lent the manuscripts
to the printers; of course Farquhar originated,
in order to give color to Mistress
Farquhar’s known pretence of riches, and
their joint subsequent poverty, the magnificent
thieving practised upon the never-thieved
and the unthievable! One
can fancy them both, in their hard chairs
in the bare room, laughing well and long,
between tears of anxious hope that the
more personal element in the <i>Miscellany</i>
might fetch them from the Covent Garden
book-stalls a parcel of fagots and a
dinner.</p>

<p>Aside from all theorizing, it is pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to know that their life together was
a happy one. The consensus of all witnesses,
in the significant absence of any
contrary voice, affirms that Farquhar,
having been trapped, bore himself like
the gentleman he was. Two children
were born to him, to brighten, but also to
sadden, his brief and diligent life. Under
his added anxieties he did his royal best;
he addressed to their mother, from first
to last, no word of reproach for her fraud.</p>

<p class="unindent">In its fragrance of faith and patience and
self-sacrificing tenderness, their domestic
story can almost rank next after that sacred
one of Charles and Mary Lamb.</p>

<p>Farquhar’s widow, who had loved him,
appears to have loved his memory.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
did not survive her husband many years;
for there is reason to suppose she died
before 1719, and in penury. Poor Farquhar
used to declare that the dread that
his family might suffer want was far more
bitter to him than death. Wilkes gave
at his theatre, in the May of 1708, a benefit
for Margaret Farquhar, and twelve
years later he was acting as trustee for
the young girls Mary and Anne Margaret,
whose pension is said by the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> to have amounted to
thirty pounds; it was obtained through
the exertions of Edmund Challoner, to
whom their father had dedicated his <i>Miscellanies</i>.
Wilkes seems to have again
aided both the orphans when they came
of age. One of them married an humble
tradesman, and died early; the other was
living in 1764, wholly uneducated, and, as
it is said on small authority, as a maid-servant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Farquhar’s elder biographers
and editors, Ware, Genest, Chetwood, and
the rest, writing in this daughter’s lifetime,
were apparently unconscious of her
existence; but the thought of her father’s
child, old, neglected, and in a menial position,
served to anger Leigh Hunt as
late as 1842.</p>

<p>Fear and forecast of what is only too
likely to befall the helpless, depressed
Farquhar in the April long ago, when he
lay dying of consumption, and when,
with a fortitude which sustained him
under his bitter disappointment, for six
weeks, he wrote and finished his masterly
comedy <i>The Beaux’ Stratagem</i>. As he
drew near the end of the second act he
was told to give up hope; but the second
act closes with the famous rattling
catechism between Cherry and Archer,
and the best bit of verse its author ever
made; and the third starts in with the
hearty sweet laugh—Anne Oldfield’s
laugh—of that “exquisite creature, Mrs.
Sullen.” On a fund of grief, Farquhar
enriched his London with a legacy of
perpetual merriment. The unflagging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
impetus of his dramas, above and beyond
their very real intrinsic merit, accounts
for their great and yet unforfeited popularity.
They descend to us associated
with the intellectual triumphs of the
most dear and dazzling names upon the
English stage; they move upon the
wings of intelligence and good-nature;
they “give delight, and hurt not.” They
swarm with soldiers, welcome figures
long tacitly prohibited from the boards,
as too painful a reminder of the Civil
Wars. They begin with the clatter of
spurs, the bang of doors, the hubbub
of bantering voices in “a broadside of
damme’s.” Sergeant Kite appears, followed
by a mob on whom he lavishes
his wheedling, inspiriting gibble-gabble;
Roebuck enters in fantastic colloquy
with a beggar; Sir Harry crosses the
road, singing, with footmen after him,
and Vizard meanwhile indicating him to
Standard as “the joy of the playhouse
and the life of the park, Sir Harry Wildair,
newly come from Paris”; <i>The Twin
Rivals</i> opens in a volley of epigrams;
the rise of the curtain in <i>The Beaux’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Stratagem</i> discloses sly old Boniface and
the ingenious Cherry calling and running,
running and calling, in a fluster
pregnant of farce and revel. Farquhar’s
pages are not for the closet; they have
little passive charm; to quote from them,
full as they are of familiar saws almost
all his own, is hardly fair. His mother-wit
arises from the ludicrous and unforeseen
predicament, not from vanity and
conscious power; it is integral, not mere
repartee; and it never calls a halt to the
action. As was well said by Charles
Cowden Clarke, “there are no traps for
jests” in Farquhar; “no trains laid to
fire <i>équivoque</i>.” The clear fun, spurting
unannounced in dialogue after dialogue,
in incident after incident; the
incessant Molière-like masquerades; the
thousand little issues depending upon
by-play and transient inspiration; the
narrowing scope and deepening sentiment
of the plot, like a secret given to
the players, to be told fully only to the
audience most in touch with them—these
commend Farquhar’s vivacious rôles to
actors, and make them both difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and desirable. With what unction, from
an actor’s lips, falls his manifold and
glowing praise of theatres! What a pretty
picture, a broad wash of rose-purple
and white, he can make of the interior
seen from the wings! “There’s such a
hurry of pleasure to transport us; the
bustle, noise, gallantry, equipage, garters,
feathers, wigs, bows, smiles, ogles, love,
music, and applause!” And again, in
another mood: “The playhouse is the
element of poetry, because the region of
beauty; the ladies, methinks, have a more
inspiring, triumphant air in the boxes
than anywhere else. They sit commanding
on their thrones, with all their subject
slaves about them; their best clothes,
best looks; shining jewels, sparkling eyes;
the treasures of the world in a ring.”
And Mirabel, who is speaking, ends with
an ecstatic sigh: “I could wish that my
whole life long were the first night of a
new play!”</p>

<p>This is a drop, or a rise, from Congreve
and his aristocratic abstractions. Farquhar,
in his youth, had modelled himself
chiefly upon the comedy of Congreve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and may be said to have perfected
the mechanism which the genius of Congreve
had brought into vogue. He never
attained, nor could attain, Congreve’s
scholarly elegance of proportion and his
consummate diction. But he had the
happiness of being no purely literary
dramatist; he had technical knowledge
and skill. He brought the existing heroes
with their conniving valets, the
buxom equivocal maids, the laughing,
masking, conscienceless fine ladies, out
of their disreputable moonlight into
healthful comic air; and added to them,
in the transfer, a leaven of homely lovableness
which will forever keep his masterpieces
upon the stage.</p>

<p>Farquhar’s original intellect has a value
only relative; he may be considered as
Goldsmith’s tutor rather than as Congreve’s
disciple. Goldsmith had no small
knowledge of Farquhar, his forerunner by
sixty years as a sizar student of Trinity;
and, like him, he is reported to have been
dropped from his class for a buffoonery.
What friends (<i>Arcades ambo</i>, in both Virgilian
and blameless Byronese) might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
these two parsons’ sons have been! Scrub,
Squire Sullen’s servant, in <i>The Beaux’
Stratagem</i>, who “on Saturday draws warrants,
and on Sunday draws beer,” was a
part Goldy once greatly desired to act.
He, too, when he came to write plays,
cast about for conventional types to handle
and improve. Tony and his incomparable
mother would hardly have been,
without their first imperfect apparition
in Wycherley’s powerful (and stolen)
<i>Plain Dealer;</i> and Young Marlow and
Hastings are frank reproductions of
Archer and Aimwell, in a much finer
situation. Miss Hardcastle hopes that in
her cap and apron she may resemble
Cherry. And no one seems to have
traced a celebrated passage in <i>The Vicar
of Wakefield</i> either to my Lady Howdye’s
message to my Lady Allnight repeated
by Archer (who in this same scene introduces
the “topical song” upon the
modern boards), or else to the example
of the manœuvring Bisarre in Act II.,
Scene I., of <i>The Inconstant</i>. Surely,
“forms which proceed from simple
enumeration and are exposed to validity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
from a contradictory instance” supplies
the unique original of the nonsense-rhetoric
which so confounded poor Moses.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
The talk of Clincher Junior and
Tim, of Kite, Bullock, Scrub, Lyric, and
the unbaptized wench Parly, of the constable
showing the big bed to Hermes
Wouldbe, the talk, that is, of Farquhar’s
common people, shows humor altogether
of what we may call the Goldsmith
order: genial, odd, grotesque paradox,
springing from Irish inconsequence and
love of human kind.</p>

<p>In the sixth year of Queen Anne, when
Farquhar died, Steele was married to his
“Prue,” and having seen the last of his
three reformatory dramas “damned for
its piety,” sought Joseph Addison’s approval
and collaboration, and fell to designing
<i>The Tatler</i>. Fielding was newborn,
Johnson just out of the cradle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Pope was trying a cunning young hand
at his first <i>Pastorals;</i> Defoe, an alumnus
of Newgate, was beating his way outward
and upward; Swift, yet a Whig, was known
but for his <i>Tale of a Tub</i>. The fresh waters
were rising on all sides to vivify the
sick lowlands of the decadence. The
kingdoms had a forgotten lesson, and
long in the learning, set before them:
to regain, as a basis for legitimate results,
their mental independence and simplicity;
to serve art for art’s sake, and to
achieve, through the reactionary formalism
of the nascent eighteenth century,
freedom and a broad ethic outlook. It
was as if Comedy, in her winning meretricious
perfections, had to die, that English
prose might live. It is enough for
an immature genius of the third order,
born under Charles the Second, to have
vaguely foreshadowed a just and imperative
change. Farquhar certainly does
foreshadow it, albeit with what theologians
might call absence of the necessary
intention.</p>

<p>He wrote excellent prefaces and prologues.
His <i>Discourse upon Comedy</i>, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the <i>Miscellanies</i>, did pioneer work for his
theory, since expounded by more authoritative
critics, and received by the English
world, that the observance or non-observance
of the dramatic unities is at
the will of the wise, and that for guidance
in all such matters playwrights
should look to Shakespeare rather than
to Aristotle. The <i>Discourse</i>, in Farquhar’s
clear, sunny, homespun, forceful
style, does him honor, and should be reprinted.
His best charm is that he cannot
be didactic. His suasion is of the
strongest, but he has the self-consciousness
of all sensitive and analytic minds,
which keeps him free here as elsewhere
from the slightest assumption of despotism.
It is very refreshing, in the face of
that incessant belaboring of the reader
which Lesage was setting as a contemporaneous
fashion, to come across Farquhar’s
gentle good-humored salutatory:
“If you like the author’s book, you have
all the sense he thought you had; if you
dislike it, you have more sense than he
was aware of!” Had he lived longer, or
a little later, we should have found him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
as well, with his turn for skirmishing
psychology, among the essayists and the
novelists. There were in him a mellowness
and an unction which have their fullest
play in professedly subjective writing.
Farquhar, after all, did not fulfil himself,
for he followed an ill outgoing fashion
in æsthetics rather than further a right
incoming one. No one can help begrudging
him to the period he adorned.
He deserved to flourish on the manlier
morrow, and to hold a historic position
with the regenerators of public taste in
England. “Ah, go hang thyself up, my
brave Crillon, for at Arques we had a
fight, and thou wert <span class="smcap">NOT</span> in it!” One
can fancy Sir Richard Steele forever
quoting that at Captain George Farquhar,
in some roomy club-window in
Paradise.</p>

the rogue Teague in <i>The Twin Rivals</i> that he speaks an
impossible brogue, which might as well be Welsh. Farquhar
did not succeed in transferring to paper the weird and
unlovely Ulster dialect with which he was familiar in boyhood,
and which had figured already in the third act of <i>Henry
the Fifth</i>, in Jonson’s Irish masque, in Shadwell’s <i>Lancashire
Witches;</i> which was simultaneously being used in
his farce <i>The Committee</i>, by Dryden’s friend Howard,
and which was afterwards to have good corroboration in
Aytoun’s <i>Massacre of the MacPherson</i>. Farquhar employs
it twice elsewhere, passably well in the case of
Torlough Macahone of the parish of Curroughabegley
(the personage who built a mansion-house for himself and
his predecessors after him), and with lamentable flatness in
that of Dugard in his last comedy. Dugard is a rival of
the nursery-maid dear to almanac humorists, who is wont
to exclaim: “Can’t ye tell boi me accint that ’tis Frinch
Oi am!” It was one of Farquhar’s inartistic mistakes that
he made no loving study of this or of anything touching
nearly his own people. His Irishmen, with the exception
of Roebuck, are either rascals or characterless nobodies.
The name Teague, or Teig, which Howard had also employed,
is old and pure North Irish; and no less pleasant
an authority than George Borrow reminds us in the
<i>Romano Lavo-Lil</i> that it is Danish in origin.</p></div>

had a duel thrust upon him; and in parrying, his
sword pierced his man. To his remorse may be ascribed
his hatred of the custom of duelling, expressed afterwards
on every occasion. Steele owed his start in life to James
Butler, Duke of Ormonde, who entered him among the
boys on the Charterhouse foundation. This peer was
grandfather to the man who failed George Farquhar.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43_43" id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43">[43]</a> Mrs. Farquhar published in 1711 an octavo volume
of the <i>Plays, Letters, and Verses</i>. Among the verses figures
a poem of six cantos dedicated to the victorious Earl of
Peterborough, entitled <i>Barcelona</i>. “It was found among
my dear deceased husband’s writings,” says the widow,
in her prefatory note. He was not at the siege, and it
is possible that the six cantos were a manuscript copy
of the effusion of some former comrade. Farquhar was
the author of several songs, one, of highly didactic complexion,
having emanated from him at the reputed age of
ten. Of these, only two are of fair lyrical quality: the
page’s song in <i>Love and a Bottle</i>, and “Tell me, Aurelia,
tell me, pray,” which Robert Southey included in his
collection.</p></div>

to Tom Jones, quoting his schoolmaster: “Polly

have taken his cue from Fielding.</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-capi">IN Samuel Johnson’s famous
circle nearly every man
stands for himself, full of
definite purpose and power.
But two young men are
there who did nothing of moment, whose
names chime often down the pages of all
his biographies, and to whom the world
must pay honor, if only for the friendship
they took and gave. As Apollo should
be set about with his Graces “tripping
neatly,” so the portentous old apparition
of Johnson seems never so complete and
endearing as when attended by these
two above all things else Johnsonians.
When the Turk’s Head is ajar in Gerrard
Street, in shadow-London; when the
“unclubable” Hawkins strides over the
threshold, and Hogarth goes by the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
with his large nod and smile; when
Chamier is there reading, Goldsmith posing
in purple silk small-clothes, Sir Joshua
fingering his trumpet, Burke and little
brisk Garrick stirring “bishop”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> in their
glasses, and the king of the hour, distinguished
by his lack of ruffles, is rolling
about in his chair of state, saying something
prodigiously humorous and wise,
it is still Bennet Langton and Topham
Beauclerk who most give the scene its
human genial lustre, standing with laughter
behind him, arm in arm. They were
his favorites, and it is the most adorable
thing about them both that they made
out to like James Boswell, who was jealous
of them. (Perhaps they had apprehended
thoroughly Newman’s fine aphorism
concerning a bore: “You may yield,
or you may flee: you cannot conquer!”)
The rare glimpses we have of their brotherly
lives is through the door which opens
or shuts for Johnson. Between him and
them was deep and enduring affection,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and what little is known of them has a
right to be more, for his sake.</p>

<p>Bennet Langton, born in 1741 in the
very neighborhood famous now as the
birthplace of Tennyson, was the elder son
of the odd and long-descended George
Langton of Langton, and of Diana his
wife, daughter of Edmund Turnor, Esquire,
of Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire.
While a lad in the fen-country, he read
<i>The Rambler</i>, and conceived the purest
enthusiasm for its author. He came to
London, indeed, on the ideal errand of
seeking him out, and, thanks to the kind
apothecary Levett, found the idol of his
imagination at home at No. 17 Gough
Square, Fleet Street. Despite the somewhat
staggering circumstances of Johnson’s
attire,—for the serious boy had
rashly presupposed a stately, fastidious,
and well-mannered figure,—he paid his
vows, and commended himself to his
new friend for once and all. Langton
entered Trinity College, Oxford, in 1757,
at the age of sixteen.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The Doctor, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
had known him about three years, followed
his career at the university with
interest, writing to Langton’s tutor, then
“dear Tom Warton,” just appointed to
the professorship of poetry held by his
father, and afterwards poet-laureate: “I
see your pupil: his mind is as exalted
as his stature,” and to Langton’s self the
sweet generality: “I love, dear sir, to
think of you.” He even paid his Freshman
a visit, and swam sportively across
a dangerous pool in the Isis, in the teeth
of his warning; and here also, in the Oxford
which was long ago his own “tent
of a night,” he fell across a part of his
destiny in the shape of that strange
bird, Mr. Topham Beauclerk, then a taking
scapegrace of eighteen. The Doctor
must have shaken his head at first, and
wondered at the juxtaposition of this
arrant Lord of Misrule and the “evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
goodness” of his admirable Langton,
until mollified by the knowledge
that a species of cult for himself, and
ardent perusal of his writings, had first
brought them together. It was a pleasant
thought to him, that of the two young
ribboned heads high in the quadrangle,
bending for the ninth time over <i>The
Reasons Why Advice is Generally Ineffectual</i>,
<i>The Mischief of Unbounded Raillery</i>,
and the jolly satire on <i>Screech-Owls;</i>
or smiling over the shy Verecundulus
and the too-celebrated Misellus who were
part of the author’s machinery for adding
“Christian ardor to virtue, and Christian
confidence to truth.”</p>

<p>Beauclerk, like Langton, was a critic
and a student; he was well-bred, urbane,
and of excellent natural parts; moreover,
he was a wit, one of the very foremost of
his day, when wits grew in every garden.
An only child, he was born in London in
the December of 1739, and named after
that benevolent Topham of Windsor who
left the manors of Clewer Brocas and
Didworth and a collection of paintings
and drawings to his father, the handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
wild Lord Sydney Beauclerk, fifth son of
the first Duke of St. Albans, and also,
in his time, a gentleman commoner of
Trinity. Lord Sydney died early, in the
autumn of 1744, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey with his hero-brother Aubrey,
whose epitaph, still to be read there,
Thomson seems to have written. All the
pretty toys and curios passed to Topham
the little boy, under the guardianship
of Lady Beauclerk, his excellent
but literal mother, once Mary Norris of
Speke in Lancashire. His tutor was
named Parker, and must have been a
much-enduring man. Young Beauclerk
grew up, bearing a resemblance in many
ways to Charles II.; and so it befell
that with his aggravating flippancy, his
sharp sense, his quiver full of gibes, his
time-wasting, money-wasting moods, foreign
as Satan and his pomps to those of
his sweet-natured college companion, he
was able to strike Dr. Johnson in his
own political weak spot. A flash of the
liquid Stuart eye was enough to disarm
Johnson at the very moment when he
was calling up his most austere frown;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
it was enough to turn the vinegar of his
wrath to the honey of kindness. <i>Il ne
nous reste qu’une chose à faire: embrassons-nous!</i>
as the wheedling Prince, at a
crisis, says to Henry Esmond. Johnson,
as everybody knows, was a Jacobite. No
sincerer testimony could he have given to
his inexplicable liking for a royal rogue
than that he allowed Nell Gwynn’s great-grandson
to tease him and tyrannize over
him during an entire lifetime. A choice
spectacle this: Mr. Topham Beauclerk,
on his introduction, literally bewitching
Dr. Samuel Johnson! The stolid moralist
was enraptured with his Jack-o’-lantern
antics; he rejoiced in his manners, his
taste and literary learning; admired him
indiscreetly, rich clothes, equipage, and
all; followed his whims meekly, expostulated
with him almost against his traitorous
impulses, and clung to him to the end
in unbroken fondness and faith.</p>

<p>Beauclerk had immense gayety and
grace, and the full force given by high
spirits. His accurate, ever-widening
knowledge of books and men, his consummate
culture, and his fearlessness, sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
handsomely on one who was regarded by
contemporary old ladies as a mere “macaroni.”
It was a matter of course that he
tried for no degree at college. The mistress
of Streatham Park, who was by no
means his adorer, and who remembered
his chief wickedness in remembering that
“he wished to be accounted wicked,” informs
us in a private jotting since published
that he was “a man of very strict
veracity.” A philosopher and a truth-teller,
whatever his worldly weaknesses,
was sure to be a character within the
range of Johnson’s affections. It was he
who most troubled the good Doctor, he
for whom he suffered in silence, with
whom he wrangled; he whose insuperable
taunting promise, never reaching any
special development, vexed and disheartened
him; yet, perhaps because of these
very things, though Bennet Langton was
infinitely more to his mind, it was Absalom,
once again, whom the old fatherly
heart loved best. Nor was he unrepaid.
None loved him better, in return,
than his “Beau,” the very mirror of the
name, who was wont to pick his way up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the grimy Fleet Street courts “with veneration,”
as Boswell records.</p>

<p>Bennet Langton, as Mr. Forster expresses
it in his noble <i>Life of Goldsmith</i>, was
“an eminent example of the high and humane
class who are content to ‘ring the
bell’ to their friends.” He was a mild
young visionary, scrupulous, tolerant, and
generous in the extreme; modest, contemplative,
averse to dissipation; a perfect
talker and reader, and a perfect listener;
with a face sweet as a child’s,
fading but now, among his kindred, on
the canvas of Sir Joshua Reynolds. He
left a gracious memory behind at Oxford,
where his musing bust adorns the old
monastic library of Trinity. He was six
feet six inches tall, slenderly built, and
slightly stooping. “The ladies got about
him in drawing-rooms,” said Edmund
Burke, “like maids about the Maypole!”</p>

<p>Miss Hawkins, in her <i>Memoirs</i>, names
him as the person with whom Johnson
was certainly seen to the fairest advantage.
His deferent suave manner was
the best foil possible to the Doctor’s extraordinary
explosions. He had supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
self-command; no one ever saw him angry;
and in most matters of life, as a
genuine contrast to his beloved friend
Beauclerk, he was apt to take things a
shade too seriously. We learn from Mr.
Henry Best, author of some good <i>Personal
and Literary Memorials</i>, that the
advance rumors of the French Revolution
found Langton, in the fullest sense,
an aristocrat; but it was not long before
he became, from conviction, a thorough
Liberal, and so remained, although he
suffered a great unpopularity, owing to
this change, in his native county. He
wrote, in 1760, a little book of essays
entitled <i>Rustics</i>, which never got beyond
the passivity of manuscript. The year
before, under the date of July 28th,
Langton contributed to the pages of
<i>The Idler</i> the paper numbered 67 and
entitled <i>A Scholar’s Journal</i>. It is a
pleasant study of procrastination and of
shifting plans, a gentle bit of humor to
be ranked as autobiographic. There is
an indorsement of Montrose in its heroic
advice to “risk the certainty of little for
the chance of much.” But Langton’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
graceful academic pen was not destined
to a public career. Perseverance of any
sort was not native to him. He fulfilled
beautifully, adds the vivacious Miss Hawkins,
“the pious injunction of Sir Thomas
Browne, ‘to sit quietly in the soft showers
of Providence,’ and might, without injustice,
be characterized as utterly unfit
for every species of activity.” Yet at
the call of duty, so well was the natural
man dominated by his unclouded will,
he girded himself to any exertion. Wine-drinking
was habitual with him, and he
felt its need to sharpen and rouse his intellect;
“but the idea of Bennet Langton
being what is called ‘overtaken,’”
wrote the same associate whom we have
been quoting, “is too preposterous to be
dwelt on.” She furnishes one illustration
of Langton’s Greek serenity. Talking
to a company, of a chilly forenoon,
in his own house, he paused to remark
that if the fire lacked attention it might
go out: a brief, casual, murmurous interruption.
He resumed his discourse,
breaking off presently, and pleading abstractedly
with eye in air: “Pray ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
for coals!” All sat looking at the fire,
and so little solicitous about the impending
catastrophe that presently Langton
was off again on the stream of his softened
eloquence. In a few minutes came
another lull. “Did anybody answer that
bell?” A general negative. “Did anybody
ring that bell?” A sly shaking
of heads. And once more the inspired
monody soared among the clouds, at
last dropping meditatively to the hearthstone:
“Dear, dear, the fire is out!”</p>

<p>Langton was the centre of a group,
wherever he happened to be, talking delightfully,
and twirling the oblong gold-mounted
snuff-box, which promptly
appeared as sociabilities began: a conspicuous
figure, with his height, his courteous
smile, his mild beauty, and his habit
of crossing his arms over his breast,
or locking his hands together on his
knee. He was a great rider, and could
run like a hound. He had a queerness of
constitution which seemed to leave him
at his lowest ebb every afternoon about
two of the clock, forgetful, weary, confused,
and without an idea in his head;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
but after a little food, he was himself
again. At dinner-parties he usually rose
fasting, “such was the perpetual flow of
his conversation, and such the incessant
claim made upon him.” A morning call
from Mr. Langton was a thing to suggest
the eternal years; yet we are told that
satiety dwelt not where he was; like
Cowley, “he never oppressed any man’s
parts, or put any man out of countenance.”
He had much the same sense
of humor as Beauclerk had, and his
speech was quite as full of good sense
and direct observation, if not as cutting.
He indicted a fault of Edmund Burke’s
in one extreme stroke: “Burke whisks
the end of his tail in the face of an
arguer!” Johnson, the arch-whisker of
tails, was not to be brought to book;
but Burke’s greatness was of a texture to
bear and enjoy the thrust. It is curious
that Langton was markedly fond of
<i>Hudibras;</i> such a relish indicates, perhaps,
the turn his own wit might have
taken, had it not been held in by too
much second thought.</p>

<p>Johnson was wont to announce that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
valued Langton for his piety, his ancient
descent, his amiable behavior, and his
mastery of Greek. “Who in this town
knows anything of Clenardus, sir, but
you and I?” he would say. In the midst
of his talk Langton would fall into the
“vowelled undertone” of the tongue he
loved, correcting himself with a little
wave of the hands, and the apologetic
phrase: “And so it goes on.” “Steeped
to the lips in Greek” he was indeed,
bursting out with a joyous salute to the
moon of Hellas, upon a friend’s doorstep,
or making grotesque Hellene puns,
for his own delight,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> upon the blank leaves
of a pocket-book. Every one familiar
with Johnsoniana will recall the charming
and spirited retort written by Dr.
Barnard, then Dean of Derry, later, Bishop
of Killaloe, which closes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“If I have thoughts and can’t express ’em,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Gibbon shall teach me how to dress ’em</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">In terms select and terse;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Jones teach me modesty and Greek;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Smith, how to think; Burke, how to speak;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">And Beauclerk, to converse!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">In all deference to the illustrious Sir
William Jones, it may be claimed that
“modesty and Greek” were the very
arts in which Langton was a past-master.
But he was an amateur, and a
private scholar, and his name was a
dissyllable; else the Dean might have
tossed at his feet as pretty a compliment
as that given in the last line to
his colleague. It must have gratified
Johnson that Langton refused, at Reynolds’s
dinner-table, “like a sturdy scholar,”
to sign the famous Round Robin
(not signed, either, by Beauclerk) which
besought him to “disgrace the walls of
Westminster with an English inscription.”
And as if to keep Langton firmly
of his own mind on the subject, it was to
him the Doctor confided the Greek quatrain,
sad and proud, which he had dedicated
to Goldsmith’s<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> memory.</p>

<p>For Bennet Langton Johnson had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>criticism but praise. He presented him
with pride to Young and to Richardson,
described him handsomely to Hannah
More, and proceeded to draw his character
for Miss Reynolds, ere she had met
him, with such “energy and fond delight”
as she avowed she never could
forget. What fine ringing metal was
Johnson’s commendation! “He is one
of those to whom Nature has not spread
her volumes, nor uttered her voices, in
vain.” “Earth does not bear a worthier
gentleman.” “I know not who will go
to Heaven if Langton does not.” And
in the sweetest and completest approval
ever put by one mortal upon another:
“<i>Sit anima mea cum Langtono!</i>” Yet
even with this “angel of a man” the Doctor
had one serious and ludicrous quarrel.</p>

<p>It was the fatal outcome of his uneven
moods that he must needs be disenchanted
at times even with his best beadsmen:
there came days when he would
deny Beauclerk’s good-humor to be anything
but “acid,” Langton’s anything but
“muddy.” He considered it the sole
grave fault of the latter that he was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
ready to introduce a religious discussion
into a mixed assembly, where he knew
scarcely any two of the company would
be of the same mind. On Boswell’s suggestion
that this may have been done for
the sake of instructing himself, Johnson
replied angrily that a man had no more
right to take that means of gaining information
than he had to pit two persons
against each other in a duel for the sake
of learning the art of self-defence. Some
indiscretion of this sort on Langton’s
part seems to have alienated the friends
for the first and last time. It was during
their transient bitterness that the Doctor
made the historic apology, across the
table, to Oliver Goldsmith; an incident
which, however beautiful in itself, was a
hard back-handed hit at Langton, standing
by. Croker’s conjecture may be true
that the business which threatened to
break a fealty of some sixteen years’ standing
arose rather from Langton’s settling
his estate by will upon his sisters, whose
tutor he had been. On hearing of it, the
Great Cham grumbled and fumed, politely
applying to the Misses Langton the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
title of “three dowdies!”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and shouting,
in a feudal warmth, that “an ancient estate,
sir! an ancient estate should always
go to males.” In fact, the Doctor behaved
very badly, very sardonically, and
was pleased to lay hold of a post by Temple
Bar one night, and roar aloud over a
piece of possible folly up in Lincolnshire
which concerned him not in the least.
But in due time the breach, whatever its
cause, was healed. The Doctor, in writing
of it, uses one of his balancing sentences:
“Langton is a worthy fellow,
without malice, though not without resentment.”
The two could not keep
apart very long, despite all the unreason
in the world. “Johnson’s quarrels,” Mr.
Forster tells us, “were lovers’ quarrels.”
Another memorable passage-at-arms,
rich in comedy, happened in the course
of one of Johnson’s sicknesses, when, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>the cloistral silence of his chamber, he
solemnly implored Bennet Langton, always
the companion who comforted his
sunless hours, to tell him wherein his
life had been faulty. His shy and sagacious
monitor wrote down, as accusation
enough, various Scriptural texts recommending
tolerance, humility, long-suffering,
and other meek ingredients which
were not predominant in the sinner’s social
composition. The penitent earnestly
thanked Langton on taking the paper
from his hand, but presently turned his
short-sighted eyes upon him from the
pillow, and emerging from what his own
verbology would call a “frigorific torpor,”
he exclaimed in a loud, wrathful, suspicious
tone: “What’s your drift, sir?”
“And when I questioned him,” so Johnson
afterwards told his blustering tale—“when
I questioned him as to what occasion
I had given him for such animadversion,
all that he could say amounted
to this: that I sometimes contradicted
people in conversation! Now, what
harm does it do any man to be contradicted?”
To this same paternal young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Langton the rebel submitted his Latin
verses; the <i>Poemata</i>, in the shape in
which we possess them, were rigorously
edited by him. And Johnson leaned upon
him in more intimate ways, as he could
never lean upon Beauclerk. To the scrupulous
nature instinctively right he made
comfortable confidences: “Men of harder
minds than ours will do many things
from which you and I would shrink; yet,
sir, they will, perhaps, do more good in
life than we.”</p>

<p>As to the Honorable Topham Beauclerk,
more volatile than Langton, he had
as steady a “sunshine of cheerfulness”
for his heritage. We find him complaining
to a friend in the July of 1773: “Every
hour adds to my misanthropy; and I
have had a pretty considerable share of
it for some years past.” This incursion
of low spirits was not normal with him.
Johnson, bewailing his own morbid habits
of mind, once said: “Some men, and
very thinking men, too, have not these
vexing thoughts. Sir Joshua Reynolds
is the same all the year round; Beauclerk,
when not ill and in pain, is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
same.” Boswell attests that Beauclerk
took more liberties with Johnson than
durst any man alive, and that Johnson
was more disposed to envy Beauclerk’s
talents than those of any one he had
ever known. Born into the freedom of
London, Beauclerk was familiar with Fox,
Selwyn, and Walpole, and with the St.
James men who did not ache to consort
with Johnson; and he was quite their
match in ease and astuteness. He walked
the modish world, where Langton could
not and would not follow; he alternated
the Ship Tavern and the gaming-table
with the court levees; Davies’s shop with
the golden insipidities of the drawing-room;
<i>la comédie</i>, <i>la danse</i>, <i>l’amour même</i>,
with the intellectual tie-wigs of Soho.
It shows something of his spirit that
whereas no member of the Club save
himself was a frequenter of White’s and
Betty’s,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> or a chosen guest at Strawberry
Hill, yet there was no person of fashion
whom he was not proud to make known
to Doctor Johnson whenever he judged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>the candidate for so genuine an honor
worthy of it. Some of these encounters
must have been queer and memorable!</p>

<p>Beauclerk’s unresting sarcasm often
flattened out Boswell and irritated the
Doctor, though Bennet Langton, in his
abandonments of enthusiastic optimism,
was never more than grazed. It is not
to be denied that this spoiled child of
the Club liked to worry Goldsmith, the
maladroit great man who might have
quoted often on such occasions the sad
gibe of Hamlet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I’ll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Stick fiery off indeed.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">What a pity that Goldsmith’s <i>Retaliation</i>
was never finished, so as to include his
portrait of Beau! He was “a pestilent
wit,” as Anthony à Wood calls Marvell.
Johnson, shy creature! deplored
Beauclerk’s “predominance over his
company.” The tyranny, however, was
gracefully and decorously exercised, if
we are to believe the unique eulogy that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
“no man was ever freer, when he was
about to say a good thing, from a look
which expressed that it was coming; nor,
when he had said it, from a look which
expressed that it had come.” Few human
beings have had a finer sense of fun
than Topham Beauclerk. He had an infallible
eye for the values of blunders,
and an incongruity came home to him
like a blessing from above. Life with
him was a night-watch for diverting objects
and ideas. When he was not studying,
he was disporting himself, like the
wits of the Restoration; and he was
equal to all emergencies, as they succeeded
one another. Every specimen
preserved of his talk is perfect of its
kind, and makes us long for a full index.
Pointed his speech was, always, and reminds
one indeed of a foil, but without
the button; a dangerous little weapon,
somewhat unfair, but carried with such
consummate flourish that those whom it
pricks could almost cheer it. “O Lord!
how I did hate that horrid Beauclerk!”
Mrs. Piozzi scribbled once on the margin
of Wraxall’s <i>Memoirs</i>, in an exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
feminine vindication of poor Beau’s accomplished
tongue.</p>

<p>He was no disguiser of his own likes
and dislikes. Politics he avoided as
much as possible; but he affected less
concern in public matters than he really
felt. “Consecrate that time to your
friends,” he writes with mock severity to
the ideal Irishman, Lord Charlemont,
“which you spend in endeavoring to
promote the interests of a half-million
of scoundrels.” For his private business
he had least zeal of all; and cites “my
own confounded affairs” as the cause of
his going into Lancashire. Beauclerk
had great tact, boldness, and independence;
his natural scorn of an oppressor
was his modern and democratic quality.
His idleness (for he was as idle by habit
as Langton was by nature) he recognized,
and lightly deprecated. Fastidious
in everything, he made “one hour of conversation
at Elmsley’s”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> his standard of
enjoyment, and his imagined extreme of
annoyance was “to be clapped on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>back by Tom Davies.” What he chose
to call his leisure (again the ancestral
Stuart trait!) he dedicated to the natural
sciences in his beloved laboratory. “I
see Mr. Beauclerk often, both in town
and country,” wrote Goldsmith to Bennet
Langton; “he is now going directly
forward to become a second Boyle, deep
in chemistry and physics.” When there
was some fanciful talk of setting up the
Club as a college, “to draw a wonderful
concourse of students,” Beauclerk, by
unanimous vote, was elected to the professorship
of Natural Philosophy.</p>

<p>Johnson’s influence on him, potent
though it was, seems to have been negative
enough. It kept him from a few
questionable things, and preserved in him
an outward decorum towards customs
and established institutions; but it failed
to incite him to make of his manifold
talents the “illustrious figure” which
Langton’s eyes discerned in a vain anticipation.
Beauclerk and the great
High Churchman went about much together,
and had amusing experiences.
On such occasions, as in all their familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
intercourse, the disciple had the true
salt of the Doctor’s talk, which, as Hazlitt
remarks, was often something quite
unlike “the cumbrous cargo of words”
he kept for professional use. In the late
winter of 1765 the two visited Cambridge,
Beauclerk having a mind to call
upon a friend at Trinity.</p>

<p>These, as we know, had their many
differences, “like a Spanish great galleon,
and an English man-o’-war”; the one
smooth, sharp, and civil, the other indignantly
dealing with the butt-end of personality.
Boswell gives a long account
of a charming dispute concerning the
murderer of Miss Reay, and the evidence
of his having carried two pistols. Beauclerk
was right; but Johnson, with quite
as solid a sense of virtue, was angry; and
he was soothed at the end only by an
adroit and affectionate reply. “Sir,”
the Doctor began, sternly, at another
time, after listening to some mischievous
waggery, “you never open your mouth
but with the intention to give pain, and
you often give me pain, not from the
power of what you say, but from seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
your intention.” And again, he said to
him whom he had compared to Alexander,
marching in triumph into Babylon:
“You have, sir! a love of folly, and a
scorn of fools; everything you do attests
the one, and everything you say the other.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Beauclerk could also lecture his
mentor. It was his steadfast counsel
that the Doctor should devote himself
to poetry, and draw in his horns of dogma
and didactics.</p>

<p>He had, ever ready, some quaint simile
or odd application from the classics; in
the habit of “talking from books,” as the
Doctor called it, he was, however, distanced
by Langton. Referring to that
friend’s habit of sitting or standing against
the fireplace, with one long leg twisted
about the other, “as if fearing to occupy
too much space,” Beauclerk likened him,
for all the world, to the stork in Raphael’s
cartoon of The Miraculous Draught.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
One of Beauclerk’s happiest hits, and certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
his boldest, was made while Johnson
was being congratulated upon his
pension. “How much now it was to be
hoped,” whispered the young blood, in
reference to Falstaff’s celebrated vow,
“that he would purge and live cleanly, as
a gentleman should do!” Johnson seems
to have taken the hint in good-humor,
and actually to have profited by it.</p>

<p>Very soon after leaving Oxford, Beauclerk
became engaged to a Miss Draycott,
whose family were well known to
that affable blue-stocking, Mrs. Montagu;
but some coldness on his part, some
sensitiveness on hers, broke off the
match. His fortune-hunting parent is
said to have been disappointed, as the
lady owned several lead-mines in her
own right. That same year, with Bennet
Langton for companion part of the
way, Beauclerk, whose health, never robust,
now began to give him anxiety,
set out on a Continental tour. Baretti,
whom he had met at home, received him
most kindly at Milan, thanks to Johnson’s
urgent and friendly letter. By his subsequent
knowledge of Italian popular customs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
he was able to testify in Baretti’s
favor, when the latter was under arrest
for killing his man in the Haymarket,
and in concert with Burke, Garrick, Goldsmith,
and Johnson, to help him, in a very
interesting case, towards his acquittal.
It was reported to Selwyn that the
handsome gambling Inglese was robbed
at Venice of £10,000! an incident which,
perhaps, shortened his peregrinations.
If the report were accurate, it would
prove that he could have been in no
immediate need of pecuniary rescue
from his leaden sweetheart. It was
Dr. Johnson’s opinion, coinciding with
the opinion of Roger Ascham on the
same general subject, that travel adds
very little to one’s mental forces, and
that Beauclerk might have learned
more in the Academe of “Fleet Street,
sir!”</p>

<p>Topham Beauclerk married Lady Diana
Spencer, the eldest daughter of the
second Duke of Marlborough, as soon as
she obtained a divorce from her first
husband. This was Frederick, Lord Bolingbroke,
nephew and heir of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
owner of that title; a very trying gentleman,
who was the restless “Bully” of
Selwyn’s correspondence; he survived
until 1787. The ceremony took place
March 12, 1768, in St. George’s, Hanover
Square, “by license of the Archbishop
of Canterbury,” both conspirators
being then residents of the parish.
Lady Diana Spencer was born in the
spring of 1734, and was therefore in her
thirty-fifth year, while Beauclerk was but
twenty-nine.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Johnson was disturbed,
and felt offended at first with the whole
affair; but he never withdrew from the
agreeable society of Beauclerk’s wife. It
is nothing wonderful that the courtship
and honey-moon was signalized
by the forfeit of Beauclerk’s place in
the exacting Club, “for continued inattendance,”
and not regained for a considerable
period. “They are in town,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>at Topham’s house, and give dinners,”
one of George Selwyn’s gossiping friends
wrote, after the wedding. “Lord Ancram
dined there yesterday, and called
her nothing but Lady Bolingbroke the
whole time!” Let us hope that “Milady
Bully” triumphed over her awkward
guest, and looked, as Earl March
once described her under other difficulties,
“handsomer than ever I saw her, and
not the least abashed;” or as deliberately
easy as when she entertained with her
gay talk the nervous Boswell who awaited
the news of his election or rejection from
the Club. She was a blond goddess,
exceedingly fair to see. In her middle
age she fell under the observant glance
of delightful Fanny Burney, who did not
fail to allow her “pleasing remains of
beauty.”</p>

<p>The <i>divorcée</i> was fond of and faithful
to her new lord, and no drawback upon his
æsthetic pride, inasmuch as she was an
artist of no mean merit. Horace Walpole
built a room for the reception of
some of her drawings, which he called
his Beauclerk Closet, “not to be shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to all the profane that come to see the
house,” and he always praised them extravagantly.
It is surer critical testimony
in her favor that her name figures
yet in encyclopædias, and that Sir Joshua,
the honest and unbought judge, much
admired her work, which Bartolozzi was
kept busy engraving. It was her series
of illustrations to Bürger’s wild ballad of
<i>Leonora</i> (with the dolly knight, the wooden
monks, the genteel heroine, and the
vigorous spectres) which, long after, helped
to fire the young imagination of Shelley.
It is to be feared that her invaluable portrait
of Samuel Johnson is not, or never
was, extant. “Johnson was confined for
some days in the Isle of Skye,” writes her
rogue of a spouse, “and we hear that he
was obliged to swim over to the mainland,
taking hold of a cow’s tail. . . . Lady Di
has promised to make a drawing of it.”
Sir Joshua’s pretty “Una” is the little
Elizabeth, afterwards Countess of Pembroke,
elder daughter of Lady Di and
Topham Beauclerk, painted the year her
father died.</p>

<p>The family lived in princely style,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
both at their “summer quarters” at Muswell
Hill, and on Great Russell Street,
where the library, set in a great garden,
reached, as Walpole mischievously
gauged it, “half-way to Highgate.”
Lady Di, an admirable hostess, proved
herself one of those odd and rare women
who take to their husbands’ old friends.
Selwyn she cordially liked, and her warmest
welcome attended Langton, whom she
would rally for his remissness, when he
failed to come to them at Richmond.
He could reach them so easily! she said;
all he need do was to lay himself at
length, his feet in London and his head
with them, <i>eodem die</i>. This Richmond
home remained her residence during her
widowhood. Walpole mentions a Thames
boat-race in 1791, when he sat in a tent
“just before Lady Di’s windows,” and
gazed upon “a scene that only Richmond,
on earth, can exhibit.” In the church of
the same leafy town her body rests.</p>

<p>Beauclerk died at his Great Russell
Street house on March 11, 1780. He had
been failing steadily under visitations of
his old trouble since 1777, when he lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
sick unto death at Bath, and when his wife
nursed him tenderly into what seemed
to Walpole a miraculous recovery. He
was but forty-one years old, and, for all
his genius, left no more trace behind than
that Persian prince who suddenly disappeared
in the shape of a butterfly, and
whom old Burton calls a “light phantastick
fellow.” His air of boyish promise,
quite unconsciously worn, hoodwinked his
friends into prophecies of his fame. He
did not give events a chance to put immortality
on his “bright, unbowed, insubmissive
head.” Yet he was bitterly
mourned. “I would walk to the extent
of the diameter of the earth to save him,”
cried Johnson, who had loved him for
over twenty years; and again, to Lord
Althorp: “This is a loss, sir, that perhaps
the whole nation could not repair.”
Boswell mentions the Doctor’s April
stroll, at this time, while he was writing
his <i>Lives of the Poets;</i> and tells us how,
returning from a call on the widow of
the companion of his youth, David Garrick,
he leaned over the rails of the
Adelphi Terrace, watching the dark river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and thinking of “two such friends as
cannot be supplied.” “Poor dear Beauclerk!”
Johnson wrote, when his violent
grief had somewhat subsided, “<i>nec, ut
soles, dabis joca!</i> His wit and his folly,
his acuteness and his maliciousness, his
merriment and his reasoning, are alike
over. Such another will not often be
found among mankind.” Beyond this
well-known and characteristic summing-up,
the Doctor made no discoverable
mention, in his correspondence, of his
bereavement, certainly not to the highly-prejudiced
Mrs. Thrale, to whom he wrote
often and gayly in the year of Beauclerk’s
death. Nor shall we know how the catastrophe
affected Bennet Langton; for
all the most interesting papers relating
to him were destroyed when the old Hall
at Langton-by-Spilsby was burned in
1855. On this subject, as on others as
intimate, he stands, perforce, silent.</p>

<p>Readers may recall a passage in Miss
Burney’s <i>Diary</i> which gives countenance
to an accusation not borne out by any
other testimony, that Beauclerk and his
wife had not lived happily together. Dining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
at Sir Joshua’s at Richmond, in 1782,
Edmund Burke, sitting next the author
of <i>Evelina</i>, took occasion, on catching
sight of Lady Di’s “pretty white house”
through the trees, to rejoice in the fact
that she was well-housed, moneyed, and
a widow. He added that he had never
enjoyed the good-fortune of another so
keenly as in this blessed instance. Then,
turning to his new acquaintance, as the
least likely to be informed of the matter,
he spoke in his own “strong and marked
expressions” of the singular ill-treatment
Beauclerk had shown his wife, and the
“necessary relief” it must have been to
her when he was called away. The statement
does not seem to have been gainsaid
by any of the company; nor was
Burke liable to a slanderous error. So
severe a comment on Beauclerk, resting,
even as it does, wholly on Miss Burney’s
veracity, ought, in fairness, to be incorporated
into any sketch of the man. On
the other side, it is pleasant to discover
that Beauclerk, in his will, made five days
before the end, bequeathed all he possessed
to his wife, and reverted to her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
estates of his children, should they die
under age. There was but one bequest
beyond these, and that was to Thomas
Clarke, the faithful valet. The executors
named were Lady Di and her brother,
Lord Charles Spencer, who had also been
groomsman at the marriage, which, despite
Burke and its own evil beginnings,
it is hard to think of as ill-starred. The
joint guardians of Charles George Beauclerk,
the only son, were to be Bennet
Langton and a Mr. Loyrester, whom
Dr. Johnson speaks of as “Leicester,
Beauclerk’s relation, and a man of good
character;” but the guardianship, provisional
in case of Lady Di’s decease, never
came into force, as she survived, in fullest
harmony with her three children, up
to August 1, 1808, having entered her
seventy-fifth year. Various private legacies
came to Langton, by his old comrade’s
dying wish, the most precious among
them, perhaps, being the fine Reynolds
portrait of Johnson, which had been painted
at Beauclerk’s cost. Under it was inscribed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">“<i>Ingenium ingens</i></span></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Inculto latet hoc sub corpore.</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Langton thoughtfully effaced the lines.
“It was kind of you to take it off,” said
the burly Doctor, with a sigh; and then
(for how could he but recall the contrast
of temperament in the two, as well as the
affectionate context of Horace?), “not
unkind in him to have put it on.” The
collection of thirty thousand glorious
books “<i>pernobilis Angli T. Beauclerk</i>” was
sold at auction. The advertisement alone
is royal reading. There is much amiable
witness to the circumstance that Beauclerk
was not only an admirer but a
buyer of his friends’ works. From some
kind busybody who attended the twenty-ninth
day of the sale, and pencilled his
observations upon the margins of the
catalogue now in the British Museum,
we learn that Goldsmith’s <i>History of the
Earth and Animated Nature</i> (nothing
less!), which was issued, with cuts, in the
year he died, was knocked down to the
vulgar for two and threepence. The
shelves, naturally, were stocked with
Johnsons. Things dear to the bibliophile
were there: innumerable first editions,
black-letter, mediæval manuscript, Elzevirs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
priceless English and Italian classics,
gathered with real feeling and pride; but
the most vivid personal interest belonged
to the unpretending Lot 3444, otherwise
known to fame as <i>The Rambler</i>, printed
at Edinburgh in 1751; for that was the
young Beauclerk’s own copy, carried with
him to Oxford, and with a fragrance, as
of a last century garden, of the first hearty
friendship of boys. One cannot help
wishing that a sentimental fate left it in
Langton’s own hands.</p>

<p>Lady Beauclerk, Topham’s mother,
had died in 1766; and he asked to be
buried beside her, or at her feet, in the
old chapel of Garston, near Liverpool:
“an instance of tenderness,” said Johnson,
“which I should hardly have expected.”
There, in the place of his choice,
he rests, without an epitaph.</p>

<p>After this the Doctor consoled himself
more than ever with Bennet Langton,
and with the atmosphere of love
and reverence which surrounded him in
Langton’s house. He had been of old
the most desired of all guests at the
family seat in Lincolnshire. “Langton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
sir!” as he liked to announce, “had a
grant of warren from Henry II.; and
Cardinal Stephen Langton, of King John’s
reign, was of this family.” Peregrine
Langton, Bennet’s uncle, was a man
of simple and benevolent habits, who
brought economy to a science, without
niggardliness, and whom Johnson declared
to be one of those he clung to
at once, both by instinct and reason;
Bennet’s father, learned, good, and unaffected,
the prototype of his learned,
good, and unaffected son, was, however,
a more diverting character. He had
sincerest esteem for Johnson, but looked
askance on him for his liberal views,
and suspected him, indeed, of being a
Papist in secret! He once offered the
Doctor a living of some value in the
neighborhood, with the suggestion that
he should qualify himself for Orders:
a chance gravely refused. Of this exemplary
but rather archaic squire, Johnson,
a dissector of everything he loved, said:
“Sir! he is so exuberant a talker in public
meetings that the gentlemen of his
county are afraid of him. No business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
can be done for his declamation.” In
his behalf, too, Johnson produced one of
his most astounding words; for having
understood that both Mr. and Mrs. Langton
were averse to having their portraits
taken, he observed aloud that “a superstitious
reluctance to sit for one’s picture
is among the anfractuosities of the human
mind.”</p>

<p>Bennet Langton married, on the 24th
of May, 1770, Mary Lloyd, daughter of the
Countess of Haddington, and widow of
John, the eighth Earl of Rothes, the stern
soldier in laced waistcoat and breastplate
beneath, painted by Sir Joshua. It
was a common saying at the time that
everybody was welcome to a Countess
Dowager of Rothes; for it did so happen
that three ladies bearing that title
were all remarried within a few years.
Lady Rothes, although a native of Suffolk,
had acquired from long residence
in Scotland the accent of that country,
which Dr. Johnson bore with magnanimously,
on the consideration that it was
not indigenous. She had a handsome
presence, full of easy dignity, and a naturalness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
marked enough in the heyday
of Georgian affectation. With a vivacity
very different from Lady Di Beauclerk’s,
she kept herself the spring and centre
of Langton’s tranquil domestic circle: a
more womanly woman historiographers
cannot find. His own charm of character,
after his marriage, slipped more
and more into the underground channels
of home-life, and so coursed on beneficently
in silence. Their children were
no fewer than nine,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> “not a plain face
nor faulty person among them:” the goddess
daughters six feet in height, and the
three sons so like their Maypole father
that they were able once to amuse the
Parisians by raising their arms to let a
crowd pass. Langton was wont to repeat
with some glee certain jests about
his height, and Dr. Johnson’s nickname
of “Lanky” he took ever with excellent
grace; and when Garrick had leaped
upon a chair to shake hands with him,
in old days, he had knelt, at parting, to
shake hands with Garrick. But the King’s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>awkward digs at his “long legs” he
found terribly distasteful, nor was he
thereby disposed to agree with the Doctor’s
enthusiastic proclamation, after the
famous interview of 1767, that George III.
was “as fine a gentleman as Charles II.”</p>

<p>It was his cherished plan to educate
his boys and girls at home, and to give
them a thorough acquaintance with the
learned languages. No social engagements
were to stand in the way of this
prime exigency. He was in great haste
to turn his young brood into Masters and
Mistresses of Arts. Johnson complained
to Miss Burney, as they were both taking
tea at Mrs. Thrale’s, that nothing
would serve Langton but to stand them
up before company, and get them to repeat
a fable or the Hebrew alphabet, supplying
every other word himself, and
blushing with pride at the vicarious learning
of his infants. But another of the
tedious royal jokes, “How does Education
go on?” actually lessened his devotion
to his self-set task, and worried him
like the water-drop in the story, which
fell forever on a criminal’s head until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
had drilled his brain. Again, both he
and his wife, even after they had moved
into the retirement of Great George
Street, Westminster, in pursuance of their
design, were far too agreeable and too accessible
to be spared the incursions of society.
In a word, Minerva found her seat
shaken, and her altar-fires not very well
tended, and therefore withdrew. Langton
impressed one axiom on his young
scholars which they never forgot: “Next
best to knowing is to be sensible that
you do not know.” An entirely superfluous
waif of a baby was once left at
the doors of this same many-childrened
house, to be fed, clothed, and petted by
Mr. Bennet Langton and Lady Rothes,
without protest. Dr. Johnson, who made
friends with all children, was especially
attached to their third girl, his god-daughter,
whom he called “pretty Mrs.
Jane,” and “my own little Jenny.” The
very last year of his life her “most humble
servant” sent her a loving letter,
extant yet, and written purposely in a
large round hand as clear as print.</p>

<p>“Langton’s children are very pretty,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Johnson wrote to Boswell in 1777, “and
his lady loses her Scotch.” But again,
during the same year, condescendingly:
“I dined lately with poor dear Langton.
I do not think he goes on well. His table
is rather coarse, and he has his children
too much about him.” Boswell takes
occasion, in reproducing this censure, to
reprehend the custom of introducing the
children after dinner: a parental indulgence
to which he, at least, was not addicted.
The Doctor gave him a mild
nudge on the subject in remarking later:
“I left Langton in London. He has
been down with the militia, and is again
quiet at home, talking to his little people,
as I suppose you do sometimes.” While
Langton was in camp on Warley Common,
in command of the Lincolnshire
troops, Johnson spent with him five delightful
days, admiring his tall captain’s
blossoming energies, and poking about
curiously among the tents. Langton
had fallen, little by little, into a confirmed
extravagance, so that the moral of Uncle
Peregrine’s sagacious living bade fair to
be lost upon him. Boswell had a quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
with Johnson on the subject of Langton’s
expenditure, during the course of which,
according to his own report, the Laird of
Auchinleck suffered a “horrible shock”
by being told that the best way to drive
Langton out of his costly house would
be to put him (Boswell) into it. The
Doctor was truly concerned, nevertheless,
about his engaging spendthrift; up to
the very end, he would implore him to
keep account-books, even if he had to
omit his Aristophanes. “He complains of
the ill effects of habit,” grumbled the
great moralizer, “and he rests content
upon a confessed indolence. He told his
father himself that he had ‘no turn for
economy!’ but a thief might as well plead
that he had no turn for honesty.” Such
were the hard hits sacred to those Dr.
Johnson most esteemed. It transpires
from his will that, by way of discouragement,
he had lent Langton £750.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>
<p>In the winter of 1785, Langton came
from the country, and took lodgings in
Fleet Street, in order to sit beside Johnson
as he lay dying, and hold his hand.
Nor was he alone in his pious offices:
the Hooles, Mr. Sestre, and several others
were there, to keep constant vigil.
Miss Burney met Langton in the passage
December 11th, two days before the end:
“He could not,” she wrote in her journal,
“look at me, nor I at him.” But through
the foggy and restless nights when Johnson
tried to cheer himself, like More and
Master William Lilly, by translating into
Latin some epigrams from the <i>Anthologia</i>,
the true Grecian beside him must have
been his chief comfort. One can picture
the old eyes turning to him for sympathy,
perhaps with that same murmured
“Lanky!” on awaking, which Boswell
laughed to hear from him one merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Hebridean morning, twelve years before.
The last summons did not come in Langton’s
presence. Hurrying over to Bolt
Court at eight of the fatal evening, he was
told that all was over three-quarters of
an hour ago. That large soul had gone
away, as Leigh Hunt so beautifully said
of Coleridge, “to an infinitude hardly
wider than his thoughts.” Then Langton,
who was wont to shape his words with
grace and ease, went up-stairs, and tried
to pen a letter to Boswell, which is more
touching than tears: “I am now sitting
in the room where his venerable remains
exhibit a spectacle, the interesting solemnity
of which, difficult as it would be
in any sort to find terms to express, so
to you, my dear sir, whose sensations
will paint it so strongly, it would be of
all men the most superfluous to”—and
there, hopelessly choked and confused, it
broke off.</p>

<p>Langton bore Johnson’s pall; and he
succeeded him as Professor of Ancient
Literature in the Royal Academy, as Gibbon
had replaced Goldsmith in the chair
of Ancient History. He survived many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
years, the delight of his company to the
last. He, like others, was given in his
later years to detailing anecdotes of his
great friend, with an approximation to
that friend’s manner. One lady critic, at
least, thought that these explosive imitations
did not become “his own serious
and respectable character.” On December
18, 1801, in Anspach Place, Southampton,
a venerable nook “between the
walls and the sea,” when Wordsworth,
Scott, and Coleridge were yet in their
unheralded prime, when Charles Lamb
was twenty-six, Byron a dreaming boy on
the Cotswold hills, and Keats and Shelley
little fair-eyed children, gentle Bennet
Langton, known to none of these, and
somewhat forgotten as a loiterer from
the march of a glorious yesterday, slipped
out of life. “I am persuaded,” wrote
one who knew him well, “that all his inactivity,
all the repugnance he showed to
putting on the harness of this world’s
toil, arose from the spirituality of his
frame of mind . . .  I believe his mind was
in Heaven, wheresoever he corporeally
existed.” He was laid under the chancel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
of ancient St. Michael’s at Southampton,
with Johnson’s fond benison, “Be my
soul with Langton’s!” inscribed on the
marble tablet above him.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The Rev.
John Wooll of Midhurst, Joseph Warton’s
editor, was one of the few present
at the funeral ceremony, and he leaves
us to infer that it had a rather neglectful
privacy, not, indeed, out of keeping with
the “godly, righteous, and sober life” it
closed. Langton’s will, drawn up in the
June of 1800, and preserved in Somerset
House, devised to the sole executrix,
his “dear wife,” who outlived him
by nearly twenty years, his real and personal
estate, his books, his wines, his
prints, his horses, and, as a gift particularly
pretty, his right of navigation in the
river Wey. George Langton was separately
provided for, but there were some
£8000 for the eight younger children.
The document is crowded with technical
details, and very long; and the manifest
inference, on the whole, is that the dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>squire’s affairs were in a prodigious tangle.
There is no wish expressed concerning
his burial, and, what is more curious,
there are no Christian formulas for the
committal of the <i>animula vagula blandula:</i>
a lack perhaps not to be wondered
at in Beauclerk’s concise testament, but
somewhat notable in the case of a person
who certainly had a soul.</p>

<p>So went Beauclerk first of the three,
Langton last, with the good ghost still
between them, as he in his homespun,
they in their flowered velvet, had walked
many a year together on this earth. The
old companionship had undergone some
sorry changes ere it fell utterly to dust and
ashes. Its happy prime had been in the
Oxford “Longs,” when the Doctor humored
his lads, and tented under their
roofs, plucking flowers at one house, and
romping with dogs at the other; or in
1764, at the starting of the immortal
Club, when the two of its founders, who
had no valid or pretended claim to
celebrity, perched on the sills like useful
genii, with a mission to overrule sluggish
melancholy, and renew the sparkle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
in abstracted eyes. How supereminently
they did what they chose to do, and what
vagaries they roused out of Johnson’s profound
hypochondria! Did not Topham
Beauclerk’s mother once have to reprove
that august author for a suggestion to
seize some pleasure-grounds which they
were passing in a carriage? “Putting
such things into young people’s heads!”
said she. Where could the innocent
Beauclerk’s elbow have been at that
moment, contrary to the canons of polite
society, but in the innocent Langton’s
ribs? The gray reprobate, so censured,
explained to Boswell: “Lady Beauclerk
has no notion of a joke, sir! She came
late into life, and has a mighty unpliable
understanding.” Who can forget the
Doctor’s visit to Beauclerk at Windsor,
when, falling into the clutches of that
gamesome and ungodly youth, he was
beguiled from church-going of a fine
Sunday morning, and strolled about outside,
talking and laughing during sermon-time,
and finally spread himself at length
on a mossy tomb, only to be told, with a
giggle and a pleased rub of the hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
that he was as bad as Hogarth’s Idle
Apprentice? Or the other visit in the
north, when, after ceremoniously relieving
his pockets of keys, knife, pencil, and
purse, Samuel Johnson, LL.D., deliberately
rolled down a hill, and landed, betumbled
out of all recognition, at the
bottom? Langton had tried to dissuade
him, for the incline was very steep, and
the candidate scarcely of the requisite
suppleness. “Oh, but I haven’t had a roll
for such a long time!” pleaded his unanswerable
big guest.</p>

<p>Best of all, we have the history of
that memorable morning when Beauclerk
and Langton, having supped together at
a city tavern, roused Johnson at three
o’clock at his Inner Temple Lane Chambers,
and brought him to the door, fearful
but aggressive, in his shirt and his little
dark wig, and his slippers down at the
heels, armed with a poker. “What! and
is it <span class="smcap">YOU</span>? Faith, I’ll have a frisk with
you, ye young dogs!” We have visions
of the Covent Garden inn, and the great
brimming bowl, with Lord Lansdowne’s
drinking-song for grace; the hucksters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and fruiterers staring at the strange central
figure, always sure to gather a mob,
even during the moment he would stand
by a lady’s coach-door in Fleet Street;
the merry boat going its way by oar to
Billingsgate, its mad crew bantering the
watermen on the river; and two of the
roisterers (equally wild, despite a little
chronological disparity of thirty years or
so) scolding the other for hastening off,
on an afternoon appointment, “to dine
with wretched unidea’d girls!” What
golden vagabondism! “I heard of your
frolic t’other night; you’ll be in <i>The
Chronicle!</i> . . .  I shall have my old friend
to bail out of the round-house!” said
Garrick. “As for Garrick, sirs,” tittered
the pious Johnson aside to his accomplices,
“he dare not do such a thing.
His wife would not let him!” All this
mirth and whim sweetened the Doctor’s
heavy life. He had other intimates, other
disciples. But these were Gay Heart
and Gentle Heart, who drove his own
blue-devils away with their idolatrous
devotion, and whose bearing towards him
stands ever as the best possible corroboration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of his great and warm nature.
With him and for him, they so fill the
air of the time that to whomsoever has
but thought of them that hour, London
must seem lonely without their idyllic
figures.</p>

<small>1778-1830</small></h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE titles of William Hazlitt’s
first books bear witness to
the ethic spirit in which he
began life. From his beloved
father, an Irish dissenting
minister, he inherited his unworldliness,
his obstinacy, his love of inexpedient
truth, and his interest in the emancipation
and well-being of his fellow-creatures.
Bred in an air of seriousness and
integrity, the child of twelve announced
by post that he had spent “a very agreeable
day” reading one hundred and sixty
pages of Priestley, and hearing two good
sermons. A year later he appeared, under
a Greek signature, in <i>The Shrewsbury
Chronicle</i>, protesting against sectarian injustice;
an infant herald in the great
modern movement towards fair play.
The roll of the portentous periods must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
have made his father weep for pride and
diversion. William’s young head was
full of moral philosophy and jurisprudence,
and he had what is the top of
luxury for one of his temperament: perfect
license of mental growth. Alone
with his parents (one of whom was always
a student and a recluse), and for
the most part without the school-fellows
who are likely to adjust the perilous effects
of books, he became choked with
theories, and thought more of the needful
repeal of the Test Act than of his
breakfast. He found his way at fourteen
into the Unitarian College at Hackney,
but eventually broke from his traces,
saving his fatherland from the spectacle
of a unique theologian. During the year
1795 he saw the pictures at Burleigh
House, and began to live. Desultory
but deep study, at home and near home,
took up the time before his first leisurely
choice of a profession. His lonely broodings,
his early love for Miss Railton, his
four enthusiastic months at the Louvre,
his silent friendship with Wordsworth
and with Coleridge; the country walks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the pages and prints, the glad tears of his
youth,—these were the fantastic tutors
which formed him; nor had he ever
much respect for any other kind of training.
The lesson he prized most was the
lesson straight from life and nature. He
comments, tartly enough, on the sophism
that observation in idleness, or the growth
of bodily skill and social address, or the
search for the secret of honorable power
over people, is not in any wise to be accounted
as learning. Montaigne, who
was in Hazlitt’s ancestral line, was of this
mind: “<i>Ce qu’on sçait droictement, on en
dispose sans regarder au patron, sans tourner
les yeulx vers son livre.</i>” Hazlitt insists,
too, that learned men are but “the
cisterns, not the fountain-heads, of knowledge.”
He hated the schoolmaster, and
has said as witty things of him as Mr.
Oscar Wilde. Yet his little portrait-study
of the mere book-worm, in <i>The Conversation
of Authors</i>, has a never-to-be-forgotten
sweetness. His mental nurture was
serviceable; it was of his own choosing;
it fitted him for the work he had to do.
Like Marcus Aurelius, he congratulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
himself that he did not squander his
youth “chopping logic and scouring the
heavens.” Hazlitt once entered upon an
<i>Inquiry whether the Fine Arts are promoted
by Academies;</i> the answer, from
him, is readily anticipated.</p>

<div class="center">“If arts and schools reply,”</div>

<p class="unindent">he might have added,—and it is a wonder
that he did not,</p>

<div class="center">“Give arts and schools the lie!”</div>

<p>Mr. Matthew Arnold made a famous
essay on the same topic, and some readers
recollect distinctly that his verdict,
for England, would be in the affirmative,
whereas it was no such matter.
Now, no man can conceive of Hazlitt
presenting both sides of a case so impartially
as to be misunderstood, especially
upon so vital a subject. He pastured,
he was not trained; and therefore
he would have you and your children’s
children scoff at universities. Indeed,
though the boy’s lack of discipline told
on him all through life, his reader regrets
nothing else which a university<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
could have given him, except, perhaps,
milder manners. Hazlitt was perfectly
aware that he had too little general
knowledge; but general knowledge he
did not consider so good a tool for his
self-set task in life as a persistent, passionate
study of one or two subjects.
Again, he is pleased to conjecture, with
bluntness, that if he had learned more he
would have thought less. (Perhaps he
was the friend cited by Elia, who gave
up reading to improve his originality!
He was certainly useful to Elia in delicate
and curious ways: a whole vein of
rich eccentricity ready for that sweet
philosopher’s working.) Hear him pronouncing
upon himself at the very end:
“I have, then, given proof of some talent
and more honesty; if there is haste and
want of method, there is no common-place,
nor a line that licks the dust. If
I do not appear to more advantage, I
at least appear such as I am.” Divorce
that remark and the truth of it from
Hazlitt, and there is no Hazlitt left. He
stood for individualism. He wrote from
what was, in the highest degree for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
purpose, a full mind, and with that blameless
conscious superiority which a full
mind must needs feel in this empty
world. His whole intellectual stand is
taken on the positive and concrete side
of things. He has a fine barbaric
cocksureness; he dwells not with althoughs
and neverthelesses, like Mr.
Symonds and Mr. Saintsbury. “I am
not one of those,” he says, concerning
Edmund Kean’s first appearance in London,
“who, when they see the sun breaking
from behind a cloud, stop to inquire
whether it is the moon.” And he takes
enormous interest in his own promulgation,
because it is inevitably not only
what he thinks, but what he has long
thought. He delivers an opinion with the
air proper to a host who is master of a
vineyard, and can furnish name and date
to every flagon he unseals.</p>

<p>None of Hazlitt’s energies went to
waste: he earned his soul early, and how
proud he was of the possession! Retrospection
became his forward horizon. He
was all aglow at the thought of that
beatific yesterday; in his every mood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
“the years that are fled knock at the
door, and enter.” He struggled no more
thereafter, having fixed his beliefs and
found his voice. He saw no occasion to
change. “As to myself,” he wrote at
fifty, referring to Lamb’s well-known “surfeits
of admiration” concerning some objects
once adored, “as to myself, any one
knows where to have me!” He adds:
“In matters of taste and feeling, one
proof that my conclusions have not been
quite shallow or hasty is the circumstance
of their having been lasting. . . . This continuity
of impression is the only thing on
which I pride myself.” A fine saying in
the <i>Boswell Redivivus</i>, attributed to Opie,
is as clearly expressed elsewhere by Hazlitt’s
self: that a man in his lifetime can
do but one thing; that there is but one
effort and one victory, and all the rest is
as machinery in motion. “What I write
costs me nothing, but it cost me a great
deal twenty years ago. I have added little
to my stock since then, and taken little
from it.” His sensations, latterly, were
“July shoots,” graftings on the old sap.
It is his boast in almost his final essay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
that his tenacious brain holds fast while
the planets are turning. He can look at
a child’s kite in heaven, to the last, with
the eyes of a child: “It pulls at my heart.”</p>

<p>His conservative habit, however, seemed
to teach him everything by inference.
In 1821, familiar with none of the elder
dramatists save Shakespeare, he borrowed
their folios, and shut himself up for six
weeks at Winterslow Hut on Salisbury
Plain. He returned to town steeped in
his theme, and with the beautiful and
authoritative <i>Lectures</i> written. Appreciation
of the great Elizabethans is common
enough now; seventy years ago,
propagated by Lamb’s <i>Specimens</i>, 1808,
it was the business only of adventurers
and pioneers. Here is a critic indeed
who, without a suspicion of audacity,
can arise as a stranger to arraign the
<i>Arcadia</i>, and “shake hands with Signor
Orlando Friscobaldo as the oldest
acquaintance” he has! The thing, exceptional
as it was, proves that William
Hazlitt knew his resources. His devoted
friend Patmore attributes his “unpremeditated
art,” terse, profound, original,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and always moving at full speed, to two
facts: “first, that he never, by choice,
wrote on any topic or question in which
he did not, for some reason or other, feel
a deep personal interest; and, secondly,
because on all questions on which he did
so feel, he had thought, meditated, and
pondered, in the silence and solitude of
his own heart, for years and years before
he ever contemplated doing more than
thinking of them.” Unlike a distinguished
historian, who, according to Horace
Walpole, “never understood anything
until he had written of it,” Hazlitt brought
to his every task a mind violently made
up, and a vocation for special pleading
which nothing could withstand.</p>

<p>Sure as he is, he means to be nobody’s
hired guide: a resolve for which the general
reader cannot be too grateful. In
wilful and mellow study of what chance
threw in his way his strength grew, and
his limitations with it. It is small wonder
that he hated schoolmasters, and the
public which expected of him schoolmaster
platitudes. He had a pride of intellect
not unlike Rousseau’s, and he seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
have had ever in mind Rousseau’s cardinal
declaration that if he were no better
than other men, he was at least different
from them. Hazlitt defined his own
functions with proper haughtiness, in the
amusing apology of <i>Capacity and Genius</i>.
“I was once applied to, in a delicate
emergency, to write an article on a difficult
subject for an encyclopædia; and
was advised to take time, and give it a
systematic and scientific form; to avail
myself of all the knowledge that was to
be obtained upon the subject, and arrange
it with clearness and method. I made
answer that, as to the first, I <i>had</i> taken
time to do all that I ever pretended to
do, as I had thought incessantly on different
matters for twenty years of my
life; that I had no particular knowledge
of the subject in question, and no head
for arrangement; that the utmost I could
do, in such a case, would be, when a systematic
and scientific article was prepared,
to write marginal notes upon it,
to insert a remark or illustration of my
own (not to be found in former encyclopædias!)
or to suggest a better definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
than had been offered in the text.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Such
independence nobly became him, and
none the less because it kept him poor.
But in the course of time, he had to work,
and keep on working, under wretched
disadvantages. He had spurts of revolt,
after long experience of compulsory composition;
his darling wish in 1822 (confided
to his wife, of all persons) being
that he “could marry some woman with a
good fortune, that he might not be under
the necessity of writing another line!”</p>

<p>There was in him absolutely nothing
of the antiquary and the scholar, as the
modern world understands those most
serviceable gentlemen. He was a “surveyor,”
as he said, erroneously, of Bacon.
He was continuously drawn into the byway,
and ever in search of the accidental,
the occult; he lusted, like Sir Thomas
Browne, to find the great meanings of
minor things. The “pompous big-wigs”
of his day, as Thackeray called them,
hated his informality, his boldly novel
methods, his vivacity and enthusiasm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>He had, within proscribed bounds, an
exquisite and affectionate curiosity, like
that of the Renaissance. “The invention
of a fable is to me the most enviable exertion
of human genius: it is the discovery
of a truth to which there is no clew,
and which, when once found out, can
never be forgotten.” “If the world were
good for nothing else, it would be a fine
subject for speculation.” It is his deliberate
dictum that it were “worth a life”
to sit down by an Italian wayside, and
work out the reason why the Italian supremacy
in art has always been along the
line of color, not along the line of form.</p>

<p>He depended so entirely upon his memory
that those who knew him best say
that he never took notes, neither in gallery,
library, nor theatre; yet his inaccuracies
are few and slight,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and he must
have secured by this habit a prodigious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>freedom and luxury in the act of writing.
He would rather stumble than walk according
to rule; and he was so pleasantly
beguiled with some of his own images
(that, for instance, of immortality the
bride of the youthful spirit, and of the
procession of camels seen across the distance
of three thousand years) that he
reiterates them upon every fit occasion.
He cites, twice and thrice, the same passages
from the Elizabethans. He is a
masterly quoter, and lingers like a suitor
upon the borders of old poesy. His infallibility,
like the Pope’s, is of narrow
scope and nicely defined. When he
steps beyond his accustomed tracks,
which is seldom, his vagaries are entertaining.
You may account for his declaration
that Thomas Warton’s sonnets
rank as the very best in the language, by
reflecting that he dealt not in sonnets
and knew nothing of them; if he prefer
<i>Hercules Raging</i> to any other Greek tragedy,
it is collateral proof that he was no
wide-travelled Grecian, nor even Euripideian;
when he gives his distinguished
preference to Shakespeare’s Helena, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
is small need of adding that Mr. Hazlitt,
albeit with an affectionate friendship for
Mary Lamb, with a mother, a sister, a
dynasty of sweethearts, and two wives,
was notoriously unlearned in women.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>The events of his life count for so little
that they are hardly worth recording.
He was born into a high-principled and
intelligent family, at Mitre Lane, Maidstone,
Kent, on the 10th of April, in the
year 1778. His infancy was passed there
and in Ireland, his boyhood in New England
and in Shropshire. Prior to a long
visit to Paris, where he made some noble
copies of Titian, he came in 1802 to
Bloomsbury, where his elder brother
John, an advanced Liberal in politics and
an excellent miniature-painter, had a studio;
and here he worked at art for several
joyous years, finally abandoning it
for literature. The portraits he painted,
utterly lacking in grace, are fraught with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>power and meaning; few of these are
extant, thanks to the fading and cracking
pigments of the modern schools.
The old Manchester woman in shadow,
done in 1803, and the head of his father,
dating from a twelvemonth later (two
things to which Hazlitt makes memorable
reference in his essays), are no longer
distinguishable, save to a very patient
eye, upon the blackened canvases in his
grandson’s possession. The picture of
the child Hartley Coleridge, begun at the
Lakes in 1802, has perished from the
damp; that of Charles Lamb in the Venetian
doublet survives since 1804, in its
serious and primitive browns,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> as the
best-known example of an English artist
not in the catalogues. Its historic value,
however, is not superior to that of two
portraits of Hazlitt himself: one a study
in strong light and shade, with a wreath
upon the head, now very much time-eaten;
and another representing him at
about the age of twenty-five, with a three-quarters
front face looking over the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>shoulder, which appeals to the spectator
like spoken truth. It is all but void of
the beauty characterizing the striking
Bewick head (especially as retouched and
reproduced in Mr. Alexander Ireland’s
valuable book of 1889, which is a sort of
Hazlitt anthology), and characterizing, no
less, John Hazlitt’s charming miniatures
of William at five and at thirteen; therefore
it can deal in no self-flattery. Fortunately,
we have from the hand which
knew him best the lank, odd, reserved
youth in whom great possibilities were
brewing; thought and will predominate
in this portrait, and it expresses the sincere
soul. It would be idle to criticise
the technique of a work disowned by its
author. Hazlitt had, as we know from
much testimony, a most interesting and
perplexing face, with the magnificent
brow almost belied by shifting eyes, and
the petulance and distrust of the mouth
and chin; but a face prepossessing on
the whole from the clear marble of his
complexion,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> remarkable in a land of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>ruddy cheeks. His lonely and peculiar
life lent him its own hue; the eager look
of one indeed a sufferer, but with the
light full upon him of visions and of
dreams:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“<i>Chi pallido si fece sotto l’ombra</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Sì di Parnaso, o bevve in sua cisterna?</i>”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1798 Hazlitt had his immortal meeting
at Wem with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
He described himself at this period
as “dumb, inarticulate, helpless, like
a worm by the wayside,” striving in vain
to put on paper the thoughts which oppressed
him, shedding tears of vexation
at his inability, and feeling happy if in
eight years he could write as many pages.
The abiding influence of his First Poet
he has acknowledged in an imperishable
chapter. For a long while he still kept
in “the o’erdarkened ways” of Malthus
and Tucker, or in the shadow, dear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
him, of Hobbes; but in 1817 the floodgates
broke, the pure current gushed out;
and in the <i>Characters of Shakespeare’s
Plays</i> we have the primal pledge of Hazlitt
as we know him, “such as had never
been before him, such as will never be
again.” From a “dumbness” and diffidence
extreme, he developed into the
readiest of writers; his sudden pages,
year after year, transcribed in his slant
large hand, went to the printers rapidly
and at first draft. The longer he used
his dedicated pen, the freer, the brighter,
the serener it grew. In the fourteen or
fifteen of his books which deal with genius
and the conduct of life, there is,
throughout, an indescribable unaffected
zest, a self-same and unwavering certitude
of handling. Once he learned his
trade, he gave himself a large field and
an easy rein. He never warmed towards
a subject chosen for him. His conversation
was non-professional. He considered
a discussion as to the likelihood of
the weather’s holding up for to-morrow
as “the end and privilege of a life of
study.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>In London, as soon as he had abandoned
painting, he became a parliamentary
reporter, and began to lecture on
the English philosophers and metaphysicians.
He furnished his famous dramatic
criticisms to <i>The Morning Chronicle</i>,
<i>The Champion</i>, <i>The Examiner</i>, and
<i>The Times</i>, and he acted later as home
editor of <i>The Liberal</i>. He married, on
May-day of 1808, Miss Sarah Stoddart,
who owned the property near Salisbury
where he afterwards spent melancholy
years alone. He fulfilled one human duty
perfectly, for he loved and reared his son.
A most singular infatuation for the unlovely
daughter of his landlady; a second
inauspicious marriage in 1824 with
a Mrs. Isabella Bridgwater; a prolonged
journey on the Continent; the failure of
the publishers of his <i>Life of Napoleon</i>,
which thus in his needful days brought
him no competence; a long illness heroically
borne, and a burial in the parish
churchyard of St. Anne’s, under a headstone
raised, in a romantic remorse after
an estrangement, by Charles Wells, the
author of <i>Joseph and his Brethren</i>,—these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
round out the meagre details of Hazlitt’s
life. He died in the arms of his son and
of his old friend Charles Lamb,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> on the
18th of September, 1830, at 6 Frith
Street, Soho.</p>

<p>His domestic experiences, indeed, had
been nearly as extraordinary as Shelley’s.
Sarah Walker, of No. 9 Southampton
Buildings, is a sort of burlesque counterpart
of that other “spouse, sister, angel,”
Emilia Viviani. Nothing in literary history
is much funnier than Mr. Hazlitt’s
kind assistance to Mrs. Hazlitt in securing
her divorce, going to visit her at
Edinburgh, and supplying funds and advice
over the teacups, while the process
was pending, unless it be Shelley’s ingenuous
invitation to his deserted young
wife to come and dwell forever with
himself and Mary! The silent dramatic
withdrawal of the second Mrs. Hazlitt,
the well-to-do relict of a colonel, who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>henceforth swallowed up in complete oblivion,
is a feature whose like is missing
in Shelley’s romance. Events in Hazlitt’s
path were not many, and his inner calamities
seem somehow subordinated to
exterior workings. It is not too much
to say that to the French Revolution and
the white heat of hope it diffused over
Europe he owed the renewal of the very
impetus within him: his moral probity,
his mental vigor, and his physical cheer.
His measure of men and things was fixed
by its standard. Other enthusiasts wavered
and went back to the flesh-pots of
Egypt, but not he. <i>Et cuncta terrarum
subacta præter atrocem animum Catonis.</i>
Towards the grandest inconsistency this
world has seen, he bore himself with a
consistency nothing less than touching.
Everywhere, always, as a friend who understood
him well reminds a later generation,
“Hazlitt was the only man of
letters in England who dared openly to
stand by the French Revolution, through
good and evil report, and who had the
magnanimity never to turn his back upon
its child and champion.” The ruin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Napoleon, and the final news that “the
hunter of greatness and of glory was himself
a shade,” meant more to him than
the relinquishment of his early and cherished
art, or the fading of the long dream
that his heart “should find a heart to
speak to.” On his last autumn afternoon,
he said what no one else would
have dared to say for him: “I have had
a happy life.” Such it was, if we are to
compute happiness by souls, and not by
the incidents which befall them. What
were the things which atoned to this reformer
for the curse of a mind too sentient,
a heart never far from breaking?
Over and above all amended and amending
abuses, the memory of the Rembrandts
on the walls of Burleigh House;
the waving crest of the Tuderley woods;
the sky, the turf, “a winding road, and
a three-hours’ march to dinner”; the
impersonator of Richard III. most to
his mind, who lighted the stage, “and
fought as if drunk with wounds”; and
the figure (how pastoral and tender!)
of the shepherd-boy bringing a nest
for his young mistress’s sky-lark, “not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
doomed to dip his wings in the dappled
dawn.” What heresy to the ancients
would be this creed of poetic
compensation! Montesquieu adhered to
it; but hardly from baffled and impassioned
Hazlitt, dying in his prime, would
the avowal have been expected. Yet he
had written almost always, as Jeffrey saw,
in “a happy intoxication.” Like the sundial,
in one of the most charming among
his miscellaneous essays, he kept count
only of the hours of joy.</p>

<p>Hazlitt’s erratic levees among coffee-house
wits and politicians, his slack dress,
his rich and fitful talk, his beautiful fierce
head, go to make up any accurate impression
of the man. Mr. P. G. Patmore
has drawn him for us; a strange portrait
from a steady hand: in certain moods
“an effigy of silence,” pale, anxious, emaciated,
with an awful look ever and anon,
like the thunder-cloud in a clear heaven,
sweeping over his features with still
fury.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> He was so much at the mercy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>an excitable and extra-sensitive organization
that an accidental failure to return
his salute upon the street, or, above
all, the gaze of a servant as he entered
a house, plunged him into an excess of
wrath and misery. Full, at other times,
of scrupulous good faith and generosity,
he would, under the stress of a fancied
hurt, say and write malicious things about
those he most honored. He must have
been a general thorn in the flesh, for he
had no tact whatever. “I love Henry,”
said one of Thoreau’s friends, “but I cannot
like him.” Shy, splenetic, with Dryden’s
“down look,” readier to give than
to exchange, Hazlitt was a riddle to strangers’
eyes. His deep voice seemed at
variance with his gliding step and his
glance, bright but sullen; his hand felt
as if it were the limp, cold fin of a fish,
and was an unlooked-for accompaniment
to the fiery soul warring everywhere with
darkness, and drenched in altruism. His
habit of excessive tea-drinking, like Dr.
Johnson’s, was to keep down sad thoughts.
For sixteen years before he died, from
the day on which he formed his resolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Hazlitt never touched spirits of any
kind. Profuse of money when he had it,
he lacked heart, says Mr. Patmore, to live
well. Wherever he dwelt there was what
Carlyle, in Hunt’s case, called “tinkerdom”;
his marriage, and his residence
under the august roof which had been
Milton’s,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> did not mend matters for him.
He covered the walls and mantel-pieces
of London landladies, after the fashion
of the French bohemian painters, with
samples of his noblest style; and the
savor of yesterday’s potions of strong tea
exhaled into their curtains. Never was
there, despite his confessional attitude, so
non-communicative a soul. He never
corresponded with anybody; he never
would walk arm in arm with anybody;
he never, perhaps from horror of the
“patron” bogie, dedicated a book to anybody.
De Quincey knew a man warmly
disposed towards Hazlitt who learned to
shudder and dread daggers when poor
Hazlitt, with a gesture habitual to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
thrust his right hand between the buttons
of his waistcoat! And he once
cheerfully requested of a cheerful colleague:
“Write a character of me for the
next number. I want to know why everybody
has such a dislike to me.” As
a social factor he was something atrocious.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
The most humane of men, his
suspicions and shyings cut him off completely
from humanity. The base war
waged upon him by the great Tory magazines
could not have affected him so
deeply that it changed his demeanor
towards his fellows; for he had the mettle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of a paladin, which no invective could
break. But, alas! he had “the canker
at the heart,” which is no fosterer of
“the rose upon the cheek.”</p>

<p>With all this fever and heaviness in
Hazlitt’s blood, he had a hearty laugh,
musical to hear. Haydon, in his exaggerated
manner, reports an uncharitable
conversation held with him once on the
subject of Leigh Hunt in Italy, during
which the two misconstruing critics, in
their great glee, “made more noise than
all the coaches, wagons, and carts outside
in Piccadilly.” His smile was singularly
grave and sweet. Mrs. Shelley wrote, on
coming back to England, in her widowhood,
and finding him much changed:
“His smile brought tears to my eyes; it
was like melancholy sunlight on a ruin.”
A man who sincerely laughs and smiles
is somewhat less than half a cynic. If
there be any alive at this late hour who
questions the genuineness of Hazlitt’s
high spirits, he may be referred to the
essay <i>On Going a Journey</i>, with the pæan
about “the gentleman in the parlor,” in
the finest emulation of Cowley; but chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and constantly to <i>The Fight</i>, with its
lingering De-Foe-like details, sprinkled,
not in the least ironically, with gold-dust
of Chaucer and the later poets: the
rich-ringing, unique <i>Fight</i>,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> predecessor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of Borrow’s famous burst about the “all
tremendous bruisers” of <i>Lavengro;</i> and
not to be matched in our peaceful literature
save with the eulogy and epitaph of
Jack Cavanagh, by the same hand. Divers
hints have been circulated, within
sixty-odd years, that Mr. Hazlitt was a
timid person, also that he had no turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
for jokes. These ingenious calumnies
may be trusted to meet the fate of the
Irish pagan fairies, small enough at the
start, whose punishment it is to dwindle
ever and ever away, and point a moral
to succeeding generations. Hazlitt’s
paradoxes are not of malice prepense,
but are the ebullitions both of pure
fun and of the truest philosophy. “The
only way to be reconciled with old
friends is to part with them for good.”
“Goldsmith had the satisfaction of
good-naturedly relieving the necessities
of others, and of being harassed to
death with his own.” “Captain Burney
had you at an advantage by never
understanding you.” Scattered mention
of “people who live on their own estates
and on other people’s ideas”; of Jeremy
Bentham, who had been translated into
French, “when it was the greatest pity
in the world that he had not been translated
into English”; of the Coleridge of
prose, one of whose prefaces is “a masterpiece
of its kind, having neither beginning,
middle, nor end”; and even of the
“singular animal,” John Bull himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
since “being the beast he is has made
a man of him”:—these are no ill shots
at the sarcastic. Congreve, with all his
quicksilver wit, could not outgo Hazlitt
on Thieves, <i>videlicet:</i> “Even a highwayman,
in the way of trade, may blow
out your brains; but if he uses foul language
at the same time, I should say
he was no gentleman!” Hazlitt’s sense
of humor has quality, if not quantity.
How was it this same sense of humor,
this fine-grained reticence, which
wrote, nay, printed, in 1823, the piteous
and ludicrous canticle of the goddess
Sarah?</p>

<p>Hazlitt was a great pedestrian from his
boyhood on, and, like Goldsmith, a fair
hand at the game of fives, which he played
by the day. Wherever he was, his pocket
bulged with a book. It gave him keen
pleasure to set down the hour, the place,
the mood, and the weather of various
ecstatic first readings. He became acquainted
with <i>Love for Love</i> in a low
wainscoted tavern parlor between Farnham
and Alton, looking out upon a garden
of larkspur, with a portrait of Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
II. crowning the chimney-piece; in his
father’s house he fell across <i>Tom Jones</i>,
“a child’s Tom Jones, an innocent creature”;
he bought Milton and Burke at
Shrewsbury, on the march; he looked up
from Mrs. Inchbald’s <i>Simple Story</i>, when
its pathos grew too poignant, to find “a
summer shower dropping manna” on his
head, and “an old crazy hand-organ playing
<i>Robin Adair</i>.” And on April 10, 1798,
his twentieth birthday, he sat down to a
volume of the <i>New Eloïse</i>, a book which
kept its hold upon him, “at the inn of
Llangollen, over a bottle of sherry and a
cold chicken!” The frank epicurean catalogue,
as of equal spiritual and corporeal
delight, is worth notice. Do we not
know that Mr. Hazlitt had wood-partridges
for supper, in his middle age, at
the Golden Cross, in Rastadt, near Mayence?
Yet he failed to record what book
lay by his plate, and distracted his attention
from her who had been a widow, and
who was already planning her respectable
exit from his society. Evidence that
he was an eater of taste is to be accumulated
eagerly by his partisans, for eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
is one of many engaging human
characteristics which establish him as
lovable—that is, posthumously lovable.
Barry Cornwall was so jealously tender
of his memory that he would have forbidden
any one to write of Hazlitt who
had not known him. As he did not warm
miscellaneously to everybody, it followed
that his friends were few. We do not
forget which one of these, during their
only difference, thought “to go to his
grave without finding, or expecting to
find, such another companion.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Hazlitt would have set himself down,
by choice, as a metaphysician. Up to the
time when his <i>Life of Napoleon</i> was well
in hand, he used to affirm that the anonymous
<i>Principles of Human Action</i>, which
he completed at twenty, in the literary
style of the azoic age, was his best work.
He was rather proud, too, of the <i>Characteristics
in the Manner of Rochefoucauld’s
Maxims</i>, his one dreary book,
which contains a couple of inductions
worthy of Pascal, some sophistries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
hollow cynicisms not native to Hazlitt’s
brain, and a vast number of the very professorisms
which he scouted. Maxims,
indeed, are sown broadcast over his pages,
which Alison the historian classified as
better to quote than to read; but they
gain by being incidental, and embedded
in the body of his fancies. His vein of
original thought comes nowhere so perfectly
into play as in its application to
affairs. His pen is anything but abstruse,</p>

<div class="center">“Housed in a dream, at distance from the kind.”</div>

<p class="unindent">He did not recognize that to display his
highest power he needed deeds and men,
and their tangible outcome to be criticised.
His preferences were altogether
wed to the past. In his essay on <i>Envy</i>
he excuses, with a wise reflection, his
comparative indifference to living writers:
“We try to stifle the sense we have
of their merit, not because they are new
or modern, but because we are not sure
they will ever be old.” Or, as Professor
Wilson said of him, with tardy but winning
kindness: “In short, if you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Hazlitt’s praise, you must die for it . . .
and it is almost worth dying for.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Yet
what an eye he has for the idiosyncrasy
at his elbow, be it in the individual or
in the race! Every contemporary of his,
every painter, author, actor, and statesman
of whom he cared to write at all,
stands forth under his touch in delicate
and aggressive outlines from which a wind
seems to blow back the mortal draperies,
like a figure in a triumphal procession
of Mantegna’s. His manner is essentially
pictorial. His sketches of Cobbett and
of Northcote, in <i>The Spirit of Obligations;</i>
of Johnson, in <i>The Periodical Essayists;</i>
of Sir Thomas Browne and Bishop
Taylor; and of Coleridge and Lamb,
drawn more than once, with great power,
from the life, will never be excelled. His
philippic on <i>The Spirit of Monarchy</i>, or
that on <i>The Regal Character</i>, is a pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
vitriol flame, to scorch the necks of
princes. His comments upon English
and Continental types, if gathered from
the necessarily promiscuous <i>Notes of a
Journey</i>, would make a most diverting and
illuminating duodecimo; the indictment
of the French is especially masterly. <i>The
Spirit of the Age</i>, <i>The Plain Speaker</i>,
the Northcote book, <i>The English Comic
Writers</i>, and the noble and little-read
<i>Political Essays</i> are packed with vital personalities.
So is <i>The Characters of Shakespeare’s
Plays</i>, full of beautiful metaphysical
analysis, as well as of vivifying
criticism. This lavish accumulation of
material, never put to use according to
modern methods, must appear to some
as a collection of interest awaiting the
broom and the hanging committee; but
until the end of time it will be a place of
delight for the scholar and the lover of
virtue. Hazlitt’s genius for assortment
and sense of relative values were not developed;
he was in no wise a constructive
critic. Mr. R. H. Hutton complained
once of Mr. Matthew Arnold that he
ranked his men, but did not portray them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Now Hazlitt, whose search is all for character,
irrespective of the historic position,
falls into the opposite extreme: he portrays
his men, but does not rank them. An
attempt to break up into single file the
merit which, with him, marches abreast,
he would look upon as a bit of arrogance
and rank impiety. He has nothing to
say of the quality which stamps Bavius
as the best elegiac poet between Gray
and Tennyson, or of the irony of Mævius,
which would place his dramas, were it
not for their loose construction, next to
Molière’s. He does not care a fig for comparisons;
or, rather, he wishes them left
to the gods, and to his perceiving reader.
Meanwhile, one face after another
shines clear upon the wall, and breathes
enchantment on a passer-by.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to be severe with
William Hazlitt, who was towards himself
so outspokenly severe. Every stricture
upon him, as well as every defence to
be urged for it, may be taken out of his
own mouth. Even the <i>Liber Amoris</i>, as
must always have been discerned, demonstrates
not only his weakness, but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
essential uprightness and innocence. His
vindication is written large in <i>Depth and
Superficiality</i>, in <i>The Pleasures of Hating</i>,
in <i>The Disadvantage of Intellectual
Superiority</i>. His “true Hamlet” is as
faithful a sketch of the author as is Newman’s
celebrated definition of a gentleman.
Hazlitt says a tender word for Dr.
Johnson’s prejudices which covers and
explains many of his own. Who can call
him irritable, recalling the splendid exposition
of merely selfish content, in
the opening paragraphs of the essay on
<i>Good Nature?</i> Yet, with all his lofty and
endearing qualities, he had a warped and
soured mind, a constitutional disability to
find pleasure in persons or in conditions
which were quiescent. He would have
every one as mettlesome and gloomily
vigilant as he was himself. His perfectly
proper apostrophe to the lazy Coleridge
at Highgate to “start up in his promised
likeness, and shake the pillared rottenness
of the world,” is somewhat comic. Hazlitt’s
nerves never lost their tension; to
the last hour of his last sickness he was
ready for a bout. Much of his personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
grief arose from his refusal to respect
facts as facts, or to recognize in existing
evil, including the calamitous perfumed
figure of Turveydrop gloriously reigning,
what Vernon Lee calls “part of the mechanism
for producing good.” He bit at
the quietist in a hundred ways, and
with choice venom. “There are persons
who are never very far from the truth,
because the slowness of their faculties
will not suffer them to make much progress
in error. These are ‘persons of great
judgment.’ The scales of the mind are
pretty sure to remain even when there
is nothing in them.” He was a natural
snarler at sunshiny people with full pockets
and feudal ideas, like Sir Walter, who
got along with the ogre What Is, and
even asked him to dine. In fact, William
Hazlitt hated a great many things with
the utmost enthusiasm, and he was impolite
enough to say so, in and out of
season. The Established Church and all
its tenets and traditions were only less
monstrous in his eyes than legendry, mediævalism,
and “the shoal of friars.” He
knew, from actual experience, the loyalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and purity of the early Unitarians, and
he praised these with all his heart and
tongue. As far as one can make out, he
had not the remotest conception of the
breadth and texture of Christianity as a
whole. His theory, for he practised no
creed except the cheap one of universal
dissent, was a faint-colored local Puritanism;
and that, as the Merry Monarch
(an excellent judge of what was not
what!) reminds us, is “no religion for a
gentleman.” But more than this, Hazlitt
had no apprehension of the supernatural
in anything; he was very unspiritual.
It is curious to see how he sidles
away from the finer English creatures
whom he had to handle. Sidney almost
repels him, and he dismisses Shelley, on
one occasion, with an inadequate but apt
allusion to the “hectic flutter” of his
verse. Living in a level country with no
outlook upon eternity, and no deep insight
into the human past, nor fully understanding
those who had wider vision
and more instructed utterance than his
own, it follows that beside such men as
those just named, then as now, Hazlitt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
has a crude villageous mien. He had
his refined sophistications; chief among
them was a surpassing love of natural
beauty. But he relished, on the whole,
the beef and beer of life. The normal was
what he wrote of with “gusto”; a word
he never tired of using, and which one
must use in speaking of himself. While
he is an admirable arbiter of what is or is
not truly intellectual, he is all at sea when
he has to discuss, for instance, emotional
poetry, or, what is yet more difficult to
him, poetry purely poetic; its inevitable
touch of the fantastic, the mystical, puts
his wits completely to rout. The stern,
lopsided, and magnificent article on Shelley’s
<i>Posthumous Poems</i> in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> for July, 1824, and his impatience
with Coleridge at his best, perfectly exemplify
this limitation. Despite his partiality
for Rousseau and certain of the early
Italian painters, most of the men whose
genius he seizes upon and exalts with
unerring success are the men who display,
along with enormous acumen and
power, nothing which betokens the morbid
and exquisite thing we have learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
to call modern culture. Hazlitt, fortunately
for us, was not over-civilized, had
no cinque-cento instincts, and would
have groaned aloud over such hedonism
as Mr. Pater’s. Homespun and manly as
he is, who can help feeling that his was
but an imperfect development? that, as
Mr. Arnold said so paternally of Byron,
“he did not know enough”? He lacked
both mental discipline and moral governance.
He has the wayward and appealing
Celtic utterance; the manner
made of largeness and simpleness, all
shot and interwoven with the hues of
romanticism. Prodigal that he is, he
cannot stoop to build up his golden
piecemeal, or to clinch his generalizations,
thrown down loosely, side by side. Esoteric
thrift is not in him, nor the spirit
of co-operation, nor the sweetest of artistic
anxieties, that of marching in line.
He has a knight-errant pen; his glad and
chivalrous services to literature resemble
those of an outlaw to the commonwealth.
Despite his personal value, he stands detached;
he is episodic, and represents
nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">He misses the white station of a classic;
for the classics have equipoise, and inter-relationship.
But it is great cause for
thankfulness that William Hazlitt cannot
be made other than he is. Time can
not take away his height and his red-gold
garments, bestow on him the “smoother
head of hair” which Lamb prayed for,
and shrivel him into one of several very
wise and weary <i>précieux</i>. No: he stalks
apart in state, the splendid Pasha of English
letters.</p>

<p>Hazlitt boasts, and permissibly, of genuine
disinterestedness: “If you wish to
see me perfectly calm,” he remarks somewhere,
“cheat me in a bargain, or tread
on my toes.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But he cannot promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>the same behavior for a sophism repeated
in his presence, or a truth repelled. In
his sixth year he had been taken, with
his brother and sister, to America, and
he says that he never afterwards got
out of his mouth the delicious tang of a
frost-bitten New England barberry. It
is tolerably sure that the blowy and
sunny atmosphere of the young republic
of 1783-7 got into him also. Liberalism
was his birthright. He flourishes his
fighting colors; he trembles with eagerness
to break a lance with the arch-enemies;
he is a champion, from his cradle,
against class privilege, of slaves who know
not what they are, nor how to wish for
liberty. But he cannot do all this in the
laughing Horatian way; he cannot keep
cool; he cannot mind his object. If he
could, he would be the white devil of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
debate. There are times when he speaks,
as does Dr. Johnson, out of all reason,
because aware of the obstinacy and the
bad faith of his hearers. Morals are too
much in his mind, and, after their wont,
they spoil his manners. Like the Caroline
Platonist, Henry More, he “has to
cut his way through a crowd of thoughts
as through a wood.” His temper breaks
like a rocket, in little lurid smoking stars,
over every ninth page; he lays about
him at random; he raises a dust of side-issues.
Hazlitt sometimes reminds one
of Burke himself gone off at half-cock.
He will not step circumspectly from light
to light, from security to security. Some
of his very best essays, as has been noted,
have either no particular subject, or fail
to follow the one they have. Nor is he
any the less attractive if he be heated,
if he be swearing</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“By the blood so basely shed</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of the pride of Norfolk’s line,”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">or scornfully settling accounts of his own
with the asinine public. When he is not
driven about by his moods, Hazlitt is set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
upon his fact alone; which he thinks is
the sole concern of a prose-writer. Grace
and force are collateral affairs. “In seeking
for truth,” he says proudly, in words
fit to be the epitome of his career, “I
sometimes found beauty.”</p>

<p><i>The Edinburgh Review</i>, in an article
written while Hazlitt was in the full of
his activity, summed up his shortcomings.
“There are no great leading principles
of taste to give singleness to his aims,
nor any central points in his mind around
which his feelings may revolve and his
imaginations cluster. There is no sufficient
distinction between his intellectual
and his imaginative faculties. He confounds
the truths of imagination with
those of fact, the processes of argument
with those of feeling, the immunities of
intellect with those of virtue.” Here is
an admirable arraignment, which goes
to the heart of the matter. Hazlitt himself
corroborates it in a confession of
gallant directness: “I say what I think;
I think what I feel.” It is this fatal
confusion which makes his course now
rapid and clear, anon clogged with vagaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
as if his rudder had run into a
mesh of sea-weed; it is this which deflects
his judgments, and leads him, in
the shrewd phrase of a modern critic, to
praise the right things for the wrong
reasons. Hazlitt’s prejudices are very
instructive, even while he bewails Landor’s
or Cobbett’s, and tells you, as it
were, with a tear in his eye, when he has
done berating the French, that, after all,
they are Catholics; and as for manners,
“Catholics must be allowed to carry it,
all over the world!” His exquisite treatment
of Northcote, a winning old sharper
for whom he cared nothing, is all due
to his looking like a Titian portrait. So
with the great Duke: Hazlitt hated the
sight of him, “as much for his pasteboard
visor of a face as for anything
else.” One of his justifications for adoring
Napoleon was, that at a levee a young
English officer named Lovelace drew from
him an endearing recognition: “I perceive,
sir, that you bear the name of the
hero of Richardson’s romance.” If you
look like a Titian portrait, if you read and
remember Richardson, you may trust a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
certain author, who knows a distinction
when he sees it, to set you up for the
idol of posterity. Hazlitt thought Mr.
Wordsworth’s long and immobile countenance
resembled that of a horse; and
it is not impossible that this conviction,
twin-born with that other that Mr.
Wordsworth was a mighty poet, is responsible
for various gibes at the august
contemporary whose memory owes so
much to his pen in other moods.</p>

<p>He is the most ingenuous and agreeable
egoist we have had since the seventeenth-century
men. It must be remembered
how little he was in touch
outwardly with social and civic affairs;
how he was content to be the always
young looker-on. There was nothing for
him to do but fall back, under given conditions,
upon his own capacious entity.
The automaton called William Hazlitt is
to him a toy made to his hand, to be
reached without effort; the digest of all
his study and the applicable test of all
his assumptions. He knew himself; he
could, and did, with decorum, approve or
chastise himself in open court. “His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
life was of humanity the sphere.” His
“I” has a strong constituency in the
other twenty-five initials. In this sense,
and in our current cant, Hazlitt is nothing
if not subjective, super-personal. His
sort of sentimentalism is an anomaly
in Northern literature, even in the age
when nearly every literary Englishman of
note was variously engaged in baring his
breast. Whether he would carp or sigh,
he will still hold you by the button, as he
held host and guest, master and valet,
to pour into their adjacent ears the mad
extravagances of the <i>Liber Amoris</i>. He
gets a little tired at his desk, after battling
for hours with the slow and stupid
in behalf of the beauty ever-living;
he wants fresh air and a reverie; he must
digress or die. And from abstractions
bardic as Carlyle’s, he runs gladly to his
own approved self. This very circumstance,
which lends Hazlitt’s pages their
curious blur and stain, is the same which
stamps his individuality, and gives those
who are drawn towards him at all an unspeakably
hearty relish for his company.
What shall we call it?—the habit, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
maudlin in him, of speaking out, of
draining his well of emotion for the
benefit of the elect; nay, even of delicate
lyric whimperings, beside which</p>

<div class="center">“Poore Petrarch’s long-deceasèd woes”</div>

<p class="unindent">take on a tinsel glamour. As the dancing-girl
carries her jewels, every one in sight
as she moves, so our “Faustus, that was
wont to make the schools ring with <i>Sic
probo</i>,” steps into the forum jingling and
twinkling with personalia. He is quite
aware of the figure he may cut: he does
not stumble into an intimacy with you
because he is absent-minded, or because
he is liable to an attack of affectation.
He is as conscious as Poussin’s giants,
whom he once described as “seated on
the tops of craggy mountains, playing
idly on their Pan’s pipes, and knowing
the beginning and the end of their own
story.” Many sentences of his, from their
structure, might be attributed to Coleridge,
the single person from whom Hazlitt
admits to have learned anything;<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
but there is no mistaking his <i>note émue:</i>
that is as obvious as the syncopations in
a Scotch tune, or the long eyes of Orcagna’s
saints.</p>

<p>He wishes you to know, at every
breathing-space, “how ill’s all here about
my heart; but ’tis no matter.” Laying
by or taking up an old print or folio, he
loosens some fond confidence to that
surprised novice, the common reader.
Like Shelley here, as in a few other affectionate
absurdities, the prince of prose,
turning from his proper affairs, assures
you that he, too, is human, hoping, unhappy;
he also has lived in Arcadia. It
is in such irrelevancies that he is fully
himself, Hazlitt freed, Hazlitt autobiographic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
“his chariot-wheels hot by driving
fast.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Who can forget the parentheses
in his advices to his little son,
about the scholar having neither mate
nor fellow, and the god of love clapping
his wings upon the river-bank to mock
him as he passes by? Or the noble and
moving passage in <i>The Pleasures of
Painting</i>, beginning with “My father was
willing to sit as long as I pleased,” and
ending with the longing for the revolution
of the great Platonic year, that those
times might come over again! He freshens
with his own childhood the garden
of larkspur and mignonette at Walworth,
and “the rich notes of the thrush that
startle the ear of winter . . .  dear in themselves,
and dearer for the sake of what is
departed.” You care not so much for
the placid stream by Peterborough as for
his own wistful pilgrimage to the nigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
farmhouse gate, where the ten-year-old
Grace Loftus (his much-beloved mother,
who survived him) used to gaze upon the
setting sun. And in a choric outburst
of praise for Mrs. Siddons, the splendor
seems to culminate less in “her majestic
form rising up against misfortune, an
antagonist power to it” (what a truly
Shakespearean breadth is in that description!);
less in the sight of her name
on the play-bill, “drawing after it a long
trail of Eastern glory, a joy and felicity
unutterable,” than in the widening dream
of the happy lad in the pit, in his sovereign
vision “of waning time, of Persian
thrones and them that sat on them”; in
the human life which appeared to him,
of a sudden, “far from indifferent,” and
in his “overwhelming and drowning flood
of tears.” He can beautify the evening
star itself, this innovator, who records
that after a tranced and busy day at the
easel, the day of Austerlitz, he watched
it set over a poor man’s cottage with
other thoughts and feelings than he shall
ever have again. There is nothing of
<i>le moi haïssable</i> in all this. It is deliberate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
naturalism; the rebellion against
didactics and “tall talk,” the milestone
of a return, parallel with that of Wordsworth,
to the fearless contemplation of
plain and near things. But in a professing
logician, is it not somewhat peculiar?
When has even a poet so centred the
universe in his own heart, without offence?</p>

<p>Hazlitt threw away his brush, as a
heroic measure, because he foresaw but
a middling success. Many canvases he
cut into shreds, in a fury of dissatisfaction
with himself. Northcote, however,
thought his lack of patience had spoiled
a great painter. He was too full of worship
of the masters to make an attentive
artisan. The sacrifice, like all his sacrifices,
great or small, left nothing behind
but sweetness, the unclouded love of excellence,
and the capacity of rejoicing
at another’s attaining whatever he had
missed. But the sense of disparity between
supreme intellectual achievement
and that which is only partial and relative,
albeit of equal purity, followed him
like a frenzy. Comparison is yet more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
difficult in literature than in art, and Hazlitt
could take some satisfaction in the
results of his second ardor. He felt his
power most, perhaps, as a critic of the
theatre. English actors owe him an incalculable
debt, and their best spirits are
not unmindful of it. He was reasonably
assured of the duration and increase of
his fame. Has he not, in one of his headstrong
digressions, called the thoughts
in his <i>Table-Talk</i> “founded as rock,
free as air, the tone like an Italian picture?”
Even there, however, the faint-heartedness
natural to every true artist
troubled him. He went home in despair
from the spectacle of the Indian juggler,
“in his white dress and tightened turban,”
tossing the four brass balls. “To
make them revolve round him at certain
intervals, like the planets in their spheres,
to make them chase one another like
sparkles of fire, or shoot up like flowers
or meteors, to throw them behind his
back, and twine them round his neck
like ribbons or like serpents; to do what
appears an impossibility, and to do it
with all the ease, the grace, the carelessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
imaginable; to laugh at, to play
with the glittering mockeries, to follow
them with his eye as if he could fascinate
them with its lambent fire, or as if he had
only to see that they kept time to the
music on the stage—there is something
in all this which he who does not admire
may be quite sure he never really admired
anything in the whole course of
his life. It is skill surmounting difficulty,
and beauty triumphing over skill. . . . It
makes me ashamed of myself. I ask
what there is that I can do as well as
this? Nothing.” A third person must
give another answer. The whole passage
offers a very exquisite parallel; for in
just such a daring, varied, and magical
way can William Hazlitt write. The astounding
result, “which costs nothing,”
is founded, in each case, upon the toil of
a lifetime. Hazlitt’s style is an incredible
thing. It is not, like Lamb’s, of one
warp and woof. It soars to the rhetorical
sublime, and drops to hard Saxon
slang. It is for all the world, and not
only for specialists. Its range and change
incorporate the utmost of many men.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
The trenchant sweep, the simplicity and
point of Newman at his best, are
matched by the pages on <i>Cobbett</i>, on
<i>Fox</i>, and <i>On the Regal Character;</i> and
there is, to choose but one opposite
instance, in the paper <i>On the Unconsciousness
of Genius</i>, touching Correggio,
a fragment of pure eloquence of a
very ornate sort, whose onward bound,
glow, and volley can give Mr. Swinburne’s
<i>Essays and Studies</i> a look as of sails waiting
for the wind. The same hand which
fills a brief with epic cadences and invocations
overwrought, throws down, often
without an adjective, sentence after sentence
of ringing steel: “Fashion is gentility
running away from vulgarity, and
afraid of being overtaken by it.” “It is not
the omission of individual circumstance,
but the omission of general truth, which
constitutes the little, the deformed, and
the short-lived in art.” The man’s large
voice in these aphorisms is Hazlitt’s unmistakably.
If it be not as novel to this
generation as if he were but just entering
the lists of authorship, it is because
his fecundating mind has been long enriching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
at second-hand the libraries of
the English world. He comes forth, like
another outrider, Rossetti, so far behind
his heralds and disciples, that his mannered
utterance seems familiar, and an
echo of theirs. For it may be said at
last, thanks to the numerous reprints of
the last seven years, and thanks to a few
competent critics, whom Mr. Stevenson
leads, that Hazlitt’s robust work is in a
fair way to be known and appraised, by a
public which is a little less unworthy of
him than his own. His method is entirely
unscientific, and therefore archaic.
If we can profit no longer by him, we can
get out of him cheer and delight: and
these profit unto immortality. Meanwhile,
what mere “maker of beautiful
English” shall be pitted against him
there where he sits, the despair of a generation
of experts, continually tossing the
four brass balls?</p>

<p>It has been said often by shallow reviewers,
and is said sometimes still, that
Hazlitt’s style aims at effect; as if an
effect must not be won, without aiming,
by a “born man of letters,” as Mr. Saintsbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
described him, “who could not
help turning into literature everything
he touched.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The “effect,” under given
conditions, is manifest, unavoidable. Once
let Hazlitt speak, as he speaks ever, in the
warmth of conviction, and what an intoxicating
music begins!—wild as that of the
gypsies, and with the same magnet-touch
on the sober senses: enough to subvert
all “criticism and idle distinction,” and
to bring back those Theban times when
the force of a sound, rather than masons
and surveyors, sent the very walls waltzing
into their places.</p>

<p>In the face of diction so joyously clear
as his, so sumptuous and splendid, it
is well to endorse Mr. Ruskin, that
“no right style was ever founded save
out of a sincere heart.” It can never
be said of William Hazlitt, as Dean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>Trench well said of those other “great
stylists,” Landor and De Quincey, that
he had a lack of moral earnestness.
What he was determined to impress
upon his reader, during the quarter-century
while he held a pen, was not
that he was knowing, not that he was
worthy of the renown and fortune which
passed him by, but only that he had rectitude
and a consuming passion for good.
He declares aloud that his escutcheon
has no bar-sinister: he has not sold himself;
he has spoken truth in and out of
season; he has honored the excellent at
his own risk and cost; he has fought for
a principle and been slain for it, from his
youth up. His sole boast is proven. In
a far deeper sense than Leigh Hunt, for
whom he forged the lovely compliment,
he was “the visionary in humanity, the
fool of virtue,” and the captain of those
who stood fast, in a hostile day, for ignored
and eternal ideals. The best thing
to be said of him, the thing for which,
in Haydon’s phrase, “everybody must
love him,” is that he himself loved justice
and hated iniquity. He shared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
groaning of the spirit after mortal welfare
with Swift and Fielding, with Shelley
and Matthew Arnold, with Carlyle
and Ruskin; he was corroded with cares
and desires not his own. Beside this
intense devotedness, what personal flaw
will ultimately show? The host who
figure in the Roman martyrology hang
all their claim upon the fact of martyrdom,
and, according to canon law,
need not have been saints in their lifetime
at all. So with such souls as his:
in the teeth of a thousand acknowledged
imperfections in life or in art,
they remain our exemplars. Let them
do what they will, at some one stroke
they dignify this earth. It is not Hazlitt,
“the born man of letters” alone,
but Hazlitt the born humanist, who bequeaths
us, from his England of coarse
misconception and abuse, a memory like
a loadstar, and a name which is a toast
to be drunk standing.</p>

verify her husband’s quotations for him. His favorite
metaphor, “Like the tide which flows on to the Propontic,
and knows no ebb,” must have passed many times under
her eye. Any reference to Othello himself, in the great
scene of Act III., would have shown four lines for William
Hazlitt’s explicit one.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_60_60" id="Footnote_60_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_60">[60]</a> Some of Hazlitt’s comments on women are full of unconscious
humor. In <i>Great and Little Things</i> he admits
being snubbed by the fair, and adds with grandiloquence:
“I took a pride in my disgrace, and concluded that I had
elsewhere my inheritance!”</p></div>

repeatedly refers to Hazlitt’s “pimples”; and Byron
credited and supplemented the allegation. Hazlitt himself
says somewhere “that to lay a thing to a person’s
charge from which he is perfectly free, shows spirit and
invention!” The calumny is not worth mention, except
as a fair specimen of the journalistic methods against which
literary men had to contend some eighty years ago.</p></div>

the Hazlitt papers at Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge’s, in
the late autumn of 1893, complains bitterly of kind Basil
Montagu, who had once put off a proffered visit from
Hazlitt, on the ground that a party of other guests was
expected. The deterred one was naturally wroth. “Yet
after this, I am not to look at him a little <i>in abstracto!</i>
This is what has soured me and made me sick of friendship
and acquaintanceship.” Hazlitt confounded cause
and effect. He was unwelcome in general gatherings
where his genius was unappreciated; and we may be sure
Montagu was sorry for it when, in the interests of concord,
he held up so deprecating and inhospitable a hand. But
among those who nursed Hazlitt in his last illness, Basil
Montagu was not the least loyal.</p></div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">But this is general: Hazlitt is specific. His particular
Fight was the great one between Neate of Bristol and
Tom Hickman the Gasman, Neate being the victor. On
May 20, 1823, Neate met Spring of Hertfordshire (so
translated out of his natural patronymic of Winter), in a
contest for the championship, and Neate himself went
under. This latter battle was mock-heroically celebrated
by Maginn in <i>Blackwood’s</i>, and Hood’s casual meteorological
simile heaped up honors on the winner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The Spring! I shrink and shudder at her name.</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For why? I find her breath a bitter blighter,</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">From Spring the fighter!”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">So that literature may be said to have set close to the
ropes in those days, from first to last.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70">[70]</a> This was the spirit of Henry Fielding on his last
voyage, hoisted aboard among the watermen at Redcliffe,
and hearing his emaciated body made the subject of jeers
and laughter. “No man who knew me,” he writes in
his journal, “will think I conceived any personal resentment
at this behavior; but it was a lively picture of that
cruelty and inhumanity in the nature of man which I
have often contemplated with concern, and which leads
the mind into a train of very uncomfortable and melancholy
thoughts.” It is a fine passage, and a strong heart,
not given to boasting, penned it. Poor Hazlitt could not
bear even an unintentional slight without imputing diabolical
malice to the offender. Yet it was certainly true
that, in his saner hours, he could suffer personal discomfort
in public without flinching, and deplore the habit
which imposed it, rather than the act.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71">[71]</a> If Hazlitt conveyed some of his best mannerisms
from Coleridge, not always transmuting them, surely the
balance may be said to be even when one discovers later
in Hartley Coleridge such an easy inherited use of Hazlitt’s
“flail of gold” as is exemplified in this summary of
Roger Ascham’s career. “There was a primitive honesty,
a kindly innocence about this good old scholar,
which gave a personal interest to the homeliest details of
his life. He had the rare felicity of passing through the
worst of times without persecution and without dishonor.
He lived with princes and princesses, prelates and diplomatists,
without offence as without ambition. Though he
enjoyed the smiles of royalty, his heart was none the
worse, and his fortunes little the better.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72_72" id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72">[72]</a> The quotation is from Coleridge, and it was applied
by him to Dryden. Hazlitt himself unconsciously expanded
and spoiled it in his essay on <i>Burke</i>. “The
wheels of his imagination did not catch fire from the rottenness
of the material, but from the rapidity of their
motion.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_73_73" id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73">[73]</a> The Rev. H. R. Haweis has another characterization
of these breathing and burning pages: “long and tiresome
essays by Hazlitt.” So they are, sure enough, if only
you be endowed to think so! Hazlitt himself gives the
diverting fact for what it is worth, that “three chimney-sweeps
meeting three Chinese in Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
they laughed at one another till they were ready to drop
down.”</p></div></div>

<p>A Foot-note to French History. By <span class="smcap">Louise
Imogen Guiney</span>. With Portrait and Map.
Small 16mo, Cloth, Ornamental, $1 00.</p></div>


<p>A fascinating career, truly, and here most
exquisitely chronicled. The little book, in its
ardor of appreciation, vivacity of portraiture,
and grace and spontaneity of style, is a masterpiece
of concise narration, and by those who
read it once will be sought with unfailing delight
again and again.—<i>Boston Beacon.</i></p>

<p>Miss Guiney writes with a love for her subject
which makes her fine discrimination all the
finer, and shows an insight into history all the
more admirable for the research which it has
compelled. This tiny volume gives evidence of
as thorough study as would fit out a post-octavo,
as some authors understand the writing of
history.—<i>Evangelist</i>, N. Y.</p>

<p>Miss Guiney has written La Rochejaquelein’s
life on a small scale, but with spirit and enthusiasm,
and her little book is very interesting.—<i>N.
Y. Tribune.</i></p>

<p>A spirited, vivid, and felicitously phrased
account of that dramatic side-issue of the French
Revolution, the Vendée War. . . . Miss Guiney’s
literary touch is always admirable and, not infrequently,
inspired.—<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>One of the most remarkable qualities of Miss Woolson’s
work was its intense picturesqueness. Few writers
have shown equal beauty in expressing the poetry of
landscape.—<i>Springfield Republican.</i></p>

<p>Characterization is Miss Woolson’s forte. Her men
and women are original, breathing, and finely contrasted
creations.—<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>Delightful touches justify those who see many points
of analogy between Miss Woolson and George Eliot.—<i>N.
Y. Times.</i></p>

<p>Miss Woolson’s power of describing natural scenery
and strange, out-of-the-way phases of American life is
undoubted. One cannot well help being fascinated by
her stories.—<i>Churchman</i>, N. Y.</p>

<p>Miss Woolson is one of the few novelists of the day
who know how to make conversation, how to individualize
the speakers, how to exclude rabid realism without
falling into literary formality.—<i>N. Y. Tribune.</i></p>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
